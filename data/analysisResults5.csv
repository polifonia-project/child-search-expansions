At the beginning the audience was told, either orally or by printed notice, that there might be some startling effects, but no one need be afraid,—all would end well, etc. It is not a difficult task to compose an effective piece to be called Night with the assistance of a grand orchestra as the main factor, and given an opening of quiet, monotonous tones, like Felicien David’s opening to his Desert, a lullaby, a lover’s serenade, and lots of such odds and ends, which any good man with a lively imagination can invent. At the Crystal Palace music of this sort was purring along and lulling people into reposeful security —all quiet as night should ever be—when suddenly the clang of real fire-bells was heard; people jumped from their seats; there was a big commotion ; fire and flames were seen apparently bursting from the roof of the Palace; ushers were rushing about telling people to sit down, for it was a part of the performance; the big doors were swung open, and in rushed two or three fire companies with their “machines,” hose, and great fire-ladders. These ladders were raised to the roof, and the firemen, in their traditional red flannel shirts and helmets, and carrying speaking-trumpets, climbed the ladders. Real water was squirted, glass was broken, cries, orders, every sort of noise concomitant of a fire was heard,—-plus the big orchestra, which was making a fearful din, sawing and blowing fortissimo through every possible diminished seventh that could be raked up out of the musical scale. It lasted long enough to make the most tremendously red-peppered musical sensation that mortal ears ever heard. It must be understood that all the previously distributed notices were not sufficient to prevent some timid souls from being alarmed. The noise and confusion created almost a panic. Some were fainting, others bursting with laughter, the cooler ones enthusiastically admiring the well-arranged piece. Finally, the fire was put out, the firemen with their machines retired, and the orchestra artistically prepared the audience for a song of praise and thanksgiving which came in the shape of Old Hundred played and sung, and joined in by the well-pleased audience.

The progranmie of the occasion consisted of selections from Strauss's operas, conducted by himself. His desk was converted for the nonce into a gorgeous flower-bed of the costliest exotics; and his appearance thereat, baton in hand, was the signal for a demonstration of affectionate rejoicing on the part of the audience, such as, according to the leading journals of the Kaiserstadt, has never before been witnessed within the walls of a Vienna theatre. He opened the entertainment with his bright little overture to Indigo — his first opera, produced at the Wieden Theatre about twenty years ago — which was rapturously re-demanded. Then came the first act of A Night in Venice, followed by the immortal Schoene blaue Donau during the entr'acte, which inimitable waltz brought down a shower of laurel wreaths upon its composer's head.

Of all the stupid things in the world, a serious opera is perhaps the most stupid, and the opera of to-night [Armida] formed no exception to this observation. The theatre is, I believe, the largest in Europe, and it is certainly too large for the singers, whose voices sound like penny trumpets on Salisbury Plain.*   * It ought to excite little wonder, that there are so few good singers in Italy; for she is unable, from her poverty, to retain those whom she has herself formed. […] Besides, the Italians of the present day have no taste for the higher kinds of music,—for full and grand harmonies,—or for instrumental music in general. If you talk to them of Haydn, Mozart, or Beethoven, they shrug up their shoulders, and tell you—"" E Musica Tedesca,—non ci abbiamo gusto."" Cherubini, their only really great composer, might perhaps be cited as an exception, […] What the Italians like, is an easy flowing melody, unincumbered, as they would call it, with too much harmony.

The Italians never like to go back;—without referring so far as their own great Corelli—Cimarosa, Paisiello, and others of equally recent date, are already become antiquated; and as Rossini is almost their only composer, he is obliged to write an opera in the interval of a few weeks, between the bringing out of the last, and its being laid on the shelf.

Such was aye amongst us and not always unnoticed, nor, as ye shall see, unsung. It was not enough that we merely chaunted, and listened; but some more ambitious, or idle if you will, they in time would try a self-conceived song. Just as if some funny little boy, bolder than the rest, would creep into the room where lay Neil Gow’s fiddle, and touch a note or two he could not name. How proud he is! how blest! for he had made a sound, and more, his playmates heard it, faith! Here I will introduce one of these early touches [the lyrics to Thom’s air ‘Lass, gin you lo’e me, tell me noe’]. […] This ditty was sung in the weaving shops, and when in the warbling of one who could lend a good voice to the occasion, and could coax the words and air into a sort of social understanding, then was it a song. I cannot remember the precise date of this melancholy creation. Sure enough some time around 1826, when banks were falling like meteors, but rather oftener; the world seemed hurrying to ruin […] Amidst all this, and more than all this, weavers would sing.",False,"The passage does not directly address or answer the scenario described.

http://data.open.ac.uk/led/lexp/1509033477958,"I was entertained in the evening with the music of some of those itinerant performers, that play at Christmas in the streets of Rome and Naples. Their native country is Basilicata, where the inhabitants of the Apennines learn from their infancy to wield the mattock with one hand, and the flageolet or bagpipe with the other. In these savages of Italy, music is not merely an art of pastime or luxury, but a talent awakened by necessity. Their usual employment is hoeing out drains, to draw the water off the land; but as there is not every year, nor in all seasons, a superabundance of rain, they take up their musical instruments for a maintenance, and, in small parties, travel over Italy, France, and Spain. Some have penetrated even into America, and returned from thence with great comparative riches, earned by their pastoral melody. Their concerts are generally composed of two musicians, who play on very long, large bagpipes, in unison:—I mean as to the tone, because one is always an octave higher than the other; while a third musician sounds a kind of hautboy, and, at the end of each ritornel, chants a rural ditty, to which the bagpipes play an accompaniment. The airs are all nearly alike, upon the model of the following Pastorale or Siciliana. [...]  The trifling differences depend upon a greater or lesser vivacity in the performers, who are wont to embellish the common tune with variations, out of their own fancy. Every air, however, is composed of two characters: the ritornel is cheerful; the vocal part, slow and mournful. The instruments are all made by the shepherds themselves, in those forms and sizes which tradition has handed down to them, and experience has taught them to imitate.",True,The passage mentioned that the itinerant performers learn to play the flageolet or bagpipe from their infancy. This indicates that children in Basilicata start learning and experiencing music at a young age.

That  Goring Thomas's charming opera would have  fared better— obtained an abiding-place in the active repertory— had it been presented in English by  the same distinguished artists, is also a matter of  doubt. Experience has proved that Covent Garden audiences do not care for opera in the vernacular, whether the work be of native or Continental origin; and it is the same, I believe, with  the audiences of the Metropolitan Opera House in  New York.

He is a very popular preacher, and has a large and flourishing congregation. Not indeed like the great German congregations where we often see two or three thousand people assembled on a Sabbath mornings but there were not less, we think, than a thousand persons present at the Bloomsbury chapel last Sunday. The church is furnished with a very good-sized organ, though its tones are harsh, and especially so are the stops of small pipes, as mixture or cornet. There is no choir, but the singing is by the people, and seems to be very general. There was a chorus of many voices; a chorus not of musical attraction, but of religious edification - excellent and appropriate. Chanting had been introduced into this congregation, and is practised by the whole collected assembly with much success. We do not hesitate to say that the chanting by all the people in Rev. Mr. Brock's church is much superior to any of the cathedral choir chanting which we have heard. The chant itself was, indeed, unfavorable to the best results, being the well-known Dr. Dupuis in A; but notwithstanding the tune-like character of the chant, the effect was truly good, and seemed to furnish a most satisfactory answer to those objectors to chanting, who say that it is impossible for a large congregation to chant together. The words were, in general, deliberately and well delivered, and with a good degree of simultaneousness on the part of the congregation. Chanting is practised in public worship in many dissenting churches in London, and in other parts of the kingdom. Indeed, although it was introduced at an earlier period into our New England churches than here, yet it seems to have spread more here, and to have taken deeper root. One reason for this may be, that here it is made a republican thing; it is in the hands of the people, and they like it. The metrical psalms were also quite well sung, and the great importance of an organ in Congregational singing was made very apparent. A custom in giving out the hymn and tune is singular. The minister first gives out the number of the hymn, and immediately afterwards the organist plays over the tune. After this the minister, who stands in the pulpit during the playing, reads the hymn, and then the singing follows.  Mr. Brock has made a much-needed reform in relation to the public prayer. He has broken up the ever-so-long prayer, and instead of it has two shorter prayers. Rev. Mr. Binney of the Weigh House chapel has done the same. The devotional exercises occupied an hour, and the sermon that followed about forty minutes, after which the meeting was dismissed by the usual benediction.",False,"The passage does not provide any information or evidence about children's experience of music.

The success of the work on the first night was ""tremendous."" Never, perhaps, had any new opera been received with such frenzied acclamation. The opera, there is no doubt, abounded in striking and captivating morceaux, and had been composed with earnestness and power. Of melody, there was a rich store, although the ever popular air, by Dr. Arne, ""Where the bee sucks,"" judiciously employed by the composer for the pantomimic music of his Ariel and as the finale of the opera, stood out amidst all its modern companions with a delicious freshness.  After the performance, Monsieur Halevy, while on the stage, was overwhelmed with congratulations. All the foreign artists were warm in their expressions of delight. One after the other they approached him to say, ""How beautiful! How charming! How exquisite is this motivo!"" Each hummed a melody. The melody was invariably the same. It was that of Arne. Poor Monsieur Halevy must have winced under it, even in the midst of his glory. Moreover, there was a drawback in the decrescendo nature of the composition. Each of the three main acts of the opera (the tempest at sea having formed a prologue) was less effective (even though good in itself) than the preceding one. Nevertheless, the opera was received with a species of wild enthusiasm. Artists, composer, author, conductor, and finally the manager, were one and all called and recalled to receive the overwhelming plaudits of the crowded house.  The singing of all employed on the occasion was ""first-rate."" Madame Sontag won herself fresh laurels, and made the part of Miranda one of the very best. But, in the midst of all that was excellent, Lablache stood out in popular estimation as the striking impersonation of the character of Caliban. It was the last, as it was the best ""creation "" of this rare artist. The music as well as the acting taxed to the utmost the powers of one already on the wane. But he rose superior to every difficulty. His Caliban was not only adjudged to be the finest delineation of the character known, even amidst the many great actors who had figured in this extraordinary part upon the English stage, but was hailed as one of the ""finest creations"" ever seen! All was novel — all was artistic in this wonderful personation. His ""dull earthiness"" and ""brute ferocity,"" his expression of animal love for Miranda, his savage exultation under the influence of wine, and his grovelling, but still revengeful despair, combined to form a masterpiece, and raised Lablache — if anything could raise him — to a loftier pinnacle of fame than before. Scarcely less striking was the Ariel of Carlotta Grisi, who exhibited more ""mind"" as well as more poetry of expression in this, than in any previous choreographic effort. Coletti, Baucarde, and Mademoiselle Parodi (in the spirited little part of the sailor Stephana, as it stood in operatic form), all came in for the crumbs which fell from the rich harvest of acclamation so lavishly bestowed upon the above-mentioned artists. It is due to the management, at the same time, to say, that all the scenic illustrations of the ""faery"" opera were fraught with a magnificence and a poetic feeling previously unknown.

He had called early, he said, in order to make me acquainted with the services at the Hofkirche, where he presides as court organist. I repaired at the appointed time to the church, which unequal, however, to most of our cathedrals, has a noble exterior and a very fine tower. It stands in a prominent and beautiful position near the bridge which crosses the Elbe. Here High Mass is celebrated every Sunday at eleven o’clock, and other services, such as are usual at Roman Catholic churches, follow during the day. The service on this occasion was most imposing, the large orchestra in the great West Gallery being occupied by about sixty performers (band and chorus), and the large organ, one of Silbermann’s best instruments, of which I intend to give a description in my next letter. Crowds of people were pressing on, and it was with some difficulty that I gained an entrance, and obtained access to Herr Merkel’s organ pew. The music consisted of a Mass in F minor, by the conductor, Herr Carl Krebs; an Offertorium, by Rastrelli ; and a Graduale, by Reissiger. With such a force of practical musicians, need I say that the music was given with thrilling power and effect ? and I have no doubt that those who were below, in the body of the church, heard the inspiring strains to much greater advantage than I who was seated amongst the performers. At the conclusion of High Mass nearly all the immense con­gregation, as well as the members of the orchestra, departed, and there followed a short service, the musical part of which was sustained by about a dozen singing boys and singing men, with organ accompaniment only. I had now an opportunity of listening to the organ, and was struck with its rich, full tone.

Paderewski was very fatigued after his heavy  work in the provinces, and begging that I would  under no circumstances ask him to play that evening. I was half amused, half annoyed by this unexpected communication, which, of course, I knew  better than to regard as inspired by my guest of  honor himself. It was also entirely superfluous, as  I always made it a strict rule never to request an  artist to perform in my house who did not come  there for that purpose or with that expressed intention. However, I thought no more about it until  after dinner, when I took an opportunity to inform  Paderewski, in a whispered “aside”, of the strange  warning I had received.

http://data.open.ac.uk/led/lexp/1469631746406,"It was my pleasure and privilege to attend the service on Trinity Sunday, and, taken altogether, rarely have I heard one more beautifully and devotionally rendered. There was no processional hymn, the organist playing, whilst the clergy and choir took their places, a soft voluntary by Archer. The confession was monotoned throughout, the more modern pretty cadences, which were permitted to be sung for some years, being now, happily, excluded. The whole of the versicles, etc., were the beautiful and time-honoured work of Tallis. The Venite was sung to a single chant by Nares, and the Psalms for the day to a double chant in A minor and major by Battishill. I very much doubt if the major adaptation of this chant was written by Battishill, any more than was the chord of the six-four preceding the tonic at the end of the second phrase. A fine effect has always been obtained at the Parish Church by the basses alone giving out, in impressive unison, the first half of the chant, the second half being followed by the full choir. It might, perhaps, have been an improvement if there had been a little more variety of expression and power in the chanting of the Psalms, in every verse of which there lies a u point to seize,” and the perception of this point will give a feeling in the rendition which will be taken as coming from the heart, although, in fact, it may be only from the lips. The choir, I venture to think, stand as precentors to the congregation, and their delivery of the poetry of the Psalms will govern the delivery of the congregation. Every syllable should be distinctly uttered—no gabble, no hurry. It would be as well that every church choir should have a master in this phonic science, in order that the Psalms shall be chanted in rythmical rule—every verse, in fact, marked out as to its harmonious form in language. I need not say how gratifying it was to me to hear the service of my lifelong friend, the late Henry Smart, sung with such power and expression. Of this work I may perhaps be permitted to repeat, what I have said elsewhere, that it is agreed by the most eminent church musicians there is nothing more complete or beautiful of its class in the whole range of music, and nothing, indeed, can be more plain or straightforward, and at the same time more appropriate to the words of the grand Ambrosian hymn than the opening phrases, “ We praise Thee, O God ; we acknowledge Thee to be the Lord"". For dignity, power, and a grand conception of the text we must go on to that part of the Te Deum commencing, “ When Thou tookest upon Thee to deliver man.” The manner in which this sublime passage is built up, rising chord upon chord with rich and flowing music, seems as if it would never stop until it reached the gates of heaven itself. It would, I think, be an improvement, of which the composer himself approved, if the closing phrase of this sublime Te Deum were sung slower and very piano, instead of in strict and unrelenting time. Smart’s Te Deum is a pattern in plan and execution. It has served to create an emulative feeling, to open new fountains, and to justify and encourage freedom in form, and a strong exhibition of individual spirit. The Creed of St. Athanasius was sung to Tallis’s old two-note chant, consisting of C and B only in the melody, and this becomes somewhat monotonous unless a great power of tone and expression be given to certain passages of the text, especially at the words, “ but One God,” etc., which is greatly enhanced by a slow and deliberate accentuation. The “Introit” (which formerly was an antiphone sung while the priest proceeded to the altar to celebrate Mass), was, “ How lovely are the messengers,” from Mendelssohn’s St. Paul and the “Anthem,” an extract from Spohr’s Last Judgment, “ And lo! a throne,” etc. Both of these were sung with good taste, and in the latter the beautiful voice of Mr. Blagbro was heard to great advantage in the solos. It would, perhaps, have been more satisfactory if one of the anthems had been by an English composer, and surely there could have been no difficulty in finding such a work. The only hymn sung was, “ Holy, Holy, Holy,” to Dykes’s well-known tune Trinity, in which the congregation joined with great devotional fervour. The Post Communion Service was Tours in F, and, excellent as it is in its way, I could not help regretting that Smart’s magnificent setting was not taken so as to have continued his services throughout the day. The whole of this important part of the service, especially the unaccompanied responses and hymn, exhibited in the highest degree the efficiency of the choir. It has been truly said that the high choir service of our Church was made out of the office of Morning Prayer. The Communion office or Mass is, of course, the high musical service in the Latin Church ; but our English Communion office, until within these few years, was a sober, secret, and almost somniferous celebration, without choir, and almost without communicants. And so it is now in too many of our local churches. But more of this hereafter. The service was concluded with what is known as Stainer’s ""Amen,” introduced first in St. Paul’s Cathedral, for which it was specially written. It contains some fine harmonical progressions, and is undoubtedly very cleverly put together, but there are two bars therein so very much like one of Palestrina’s celebrated works as would almost cause me to mistake one for the other. During the departure of the congregation, Dr. Creser played an expressive little voluntary on the sweet stops of the echo and choir organs, which were, I believe, voiced by Schulze himself. On special occasions—Christmastide and Lent—oratorios are given in the Parish Church with increased musical resources, and greatly, I am persuaded, to the religious edification of those who attend them. Listening to an oratorio or an anthem is no direct act of worship, whether in or out of a church, nor is listening to a sermon ; but the hearing of an oratorio is, with that of hearing a sermon, a religious act, and commonly a much more profitable and instructive employment of time.  I will conclude this notice by observing that all church music should be of so exalted a character as will delight the genuine composer, exhilarate the organist and singers, and stimulate each and all to exert their utmost abilities for the attainment of a musical service as faultless as possible.",False,The passage does not address or answer the scenario as it focuses on church music and does not provide any information specifically related to children's experiences with music.

The “ pleasures of memory ” were never more thoroughly realized by any one than by me at this moment of writing ; after a lapse of over fifty years, the picture of the dancing children is before me in its living, pulsating shape. The whole audience was seemingly in ecstasy with the performance. The happy, bright faces and the gleeful play of the children stirred up the deepest emotions of the spectators. Many people were in tears. I know that the old oboist at my elbow did not play many notes during the early part of the waltz, for tears ran down his face like rain. When the dance finally ended and the curtain fell, the audience was in a kind of emotional insanity, and gave vent to it in wild applause. The scenes were so wonderfully beautiful, and so unlike anything before witnessed by a majority of the audience, that they felt as if they had had a dream or vision of Paradise",True,"The passage describes a specific event where children are depicted experiencing music.

More than once did he enjoy Handel's ' Acis and Galatea,' then brought out in the full perfection of the combined fine arts, as each could be brought to bear on the performance—the bright and graceful, though frivolous poetry of Gay ; the depth and breadth and versatility of Handel's musical feeling, as he endeavoured to represent the tragedy first in preparation and then in solution ; the luxury of decoration achieving the effect and earning the praise of landscape-painting; the pastoral groups elevated by the just choice of drapery into a peasantry of ancient Greece ; and last not least effective, the voices and demeanour of the performers.",False,"The passage does not address the scenario of characterizing children's experience of music as witnessed in bibliographic and artistic sources.

http://data.open.ac.uk/led/lexp/1448281888079,"A rich programme was presented this evening. The concert opened with an overture which is a great favorite here, and often played in public, though I have not heard it in America,— “Iphigene in Aulis,” by Gluck. It is a charming overture, and any one’s musical reputation might safely rest on the production of a single piece like this. Its subjects are at once natural and beautiful, and they are always treated in a most masterly manner; with elaborateness it is always intelligible, and with copiousness it is never diffuse. There is no departing from the main topic of discourse, no wandering in the mazes of thick darkness, or searching for ideas, but the leading thoughts are kept ever before the mind, presented now in this form, and now in that. Its analogies are perfect, its contrasts are striking, and its light and shade are applied with the hand of a Raphael or a Turner. It is full of pleasing melody, yet always subject to the laws of good taste, and manifesting both genius and science; it is in the performance, perhaps, equally satisfactory both to the musician and to the mere unstudied lover of song. The second piece was an extract (first and second movements) of Cherubini’s Requiem, written for male voices. This, which is one of Cherubini’s great works, was written under circumstances somewhat exciting, as I remember to have heard years ago. On some funeral occasion when a Requiem was desired, that which he had previously written was rejected, because composed for a mixed choir; this caused him to put forth his energies, in the production of a mass for men’s voices only. The music throughout is of a very high character, though it would not much interest those who desire musical gratification only from pretty tunes or pleasant voices. The first movement, “Requiem aeternam” with its accompaniment of violoncellos and double basses, is plaintive and sad, and tells only of sorrow, penitence and grief. In the “Dies irae,” the full powers of the orchestra are brought into requisition; and uniting, as was the case on the present occasion, with sixty well-trained and fearless men’s voices, the effect was awfully grand and commanding. The majestic movements, the severely dissonant harmonies, the wailings of the strings, the frightful appeals of the instruments of blast and percussion, and the cryings out of the voices, all combined to produce an effect which was, at times, truly terrific and overwhelming. The nineteen stanzas, however, have furnished an opportunity for musical contrasts which have been well introduced, affording variety and relief. The third piece was the very unique but, to the musician, highly interesting ""Concert fur 2 claviere (c moll) Von J. S. Bach."" Following the Requiem, it was like a delightful calm after a storm, enabling one to realize where he was, to breathe easily again, and put on a cheerful countenance. Several part-songs were then sung by the “Mannerchor” without accompaniment. The second part consisted of the “Sinfonie in C minor, by L. Von Beethoven” What a symphonie this is! We have often heard it, and it is well known in America. We will not attempt a description; we listened with intense interest to the whole of it, hardly daring to breathe in the piano and not having the power to do so in the forte passages.

Anticipating this, our company, consisting of three persons, went a little before the time appointed for the opening of the door; but yet we found a crowd gathered; the room filled immediately as the door was opened, but we succeeded in obtaining good seats. We had now to wait a full hour before the music commenced, but in the midst of such a multitude of good-looking and well-dressed ladies and gentlemen, all in conversation in loud and merry voices, it soon passed away. Half an hour before the commencement, the oboe was heard, running the scales, &amp;c.; this was soon followed by faggotti, corni, clarionetti, and strings; every man tuning and getting his instrument and his fingers in readiness. Mendelssohn seemed to look down from his bust immediately opposite the orchestra with approbation. At half-past six precisely, Kapelmeister Rietz takes his stand — the signal is given — every one is silent and attentive, and Beethoven’s overture (op. 124) fills the whole company with delight. This is a very pleasing overture; it is less learned, but of a more popular character than most of Beethoven’s. It is often marked with a rhythm like the music of the march or dance; and the flourishes of the brass instruments and drums almost lead one to suppose that he is listening to a military band. But still the hand of the master is seen, and although Beethoven comes down and freely holds conversation with the people, yet he always preserves his dignity, and never dishonors his profession in this pleasing composition. A very good singer followed; Frau Leopoldine Tuczek-Herrenburg, from Berlin, in a Recitative and Arie from the opera of “Sylvana,” by C. Maria von Weber. This was followed by a grand Concerto for the Piano Forte, with orchestral accompaniment (G moll), composed by J. Moschelles, and played by Clara Schumann. I have already spoken of Madame Schumann’s playing; her performance of this Concerto was perfect, and received the warmest approbation from the audience. An air of De Beriot followed, by Frau Tuczek-Herrenburg; after which Madame Schumann played most charmingly a Notturno (B. major) for piano forte, by F. Chopin. In this she was encored, and played in answer to the call another piece unknown to the writer. The second part of the concert was that in which the musical ones were most deeply interested, for it consisted of Robert Schumann's new Symphonie. This has not been published, and was played from manuscript, conducted by the author, who was cordially greeted on his appearance at the head of the orchestra. It is undoubtedly a work of great merit; but it is truly a great work, and can only be performed by a very thoroughly trained band. Its analogies and correspondencies are deeper and more hidden than in Mozart or Beethoven, but nevertheless they are there, and can be discovered to some extent even at a first hearing. The Symphonie consists of five movements, there being in addition to the usual movements a short adagio (fourth) introduced. In the second movement (scherzo), there is playfulness and relief, but throughout the whole the idea of greatness prevails; so much so as almost to oppress one with a feeling of grandeur and sublimity. The fourth movement especially seems to partake in the highest degree of this character, and stirs up the deep feelings to awe and reverence. But vain is any attempt at description, especially by one who has heard it but at a single performance. It was played with great energy; every member of the orchestra had enough to do. The captain inspired confidence, and the result was most satisfactory. There was but a momentary pause between the parts, and in this respect the learned conductor’s example is well worthy of imitation. The Symphonie occupied thirty-three minutes in its performance, and at half-past eight the concert closed.",False,The given passage does not provide any information or evidence pertaining to children’s experience of music.

Her Carmen was already famous. It was considered as good dramatically as that of Mme. Galli-Marie, and in a vocal sense far superior. Garcia was simply delighted with the artistic finish, the vivacity and charm, of her performance. He thought she had caught with marvelous instinct and truth the peculiarities of the Spanish type, the coquettish manners and the defiant devilry of the wayward  gipsy.

The text of the latter had been modified by Mr. Edward Taylor, so as to coincide with and comprehend that of Milton almost entirely, incorporating the newly-introduced portions by interspersing other Handelian passages, selected from his forgotten works, whether operas, or small and little noticed oratorios. According to Mr. Taylor, Handel had adopted a movement from Palestrina, and worked out a passage of ' Samson ' upon that guiding-thread : this suggested and gave occasion for the introduction of a hymn, founded upon an inexpressibly fine conception of Palestrina's. Nobody was aware of this, and all declared it to be the most striking part; the Bishop caused it to be repeated, and the whole assembly (above 2,000 in number) rose and remained standing, as during devotional pieces. After this piece, the greatest effect was produced by a short chorus, which no one had heard before : and that was, equally from the Septime, borrowed from Carissimo. This system of intercalation is in itself indefensible : but I must confess that the text, as it is, has a fine effect : the action progresses dramatically, and nothing could be easier than to make a representation with entire dramatic effect of this ' Samson' : an idea for which I sought to obtain acceptance.'",False,The passage does not directly address or answer the scenario of characterizing children's experience of music.

For some years she had held the proud position of the most celebrated prima donna on the lyric stage in Italy. Her advent was naturally heralded by many a flourish of trumpets, not one of which, perhaps, was louder than her great reputation merited. Italy had proclaimed her ""the first among the first."" There was nothing, therefore, which in the slightest degree savoured of ""humbug"" in the ""puff preliminary."" She was not only a great singer and a great actress; she was, moreover, a fine woman. Italy was enthusiastic about her — why should not England be so likewise ? As it turned out, Madame Frezzolini was received in England with favour, but not with enthusiasm. At all events, her success did not reach the point anticipated. This result may be ascribed to the fact, that her health had suffered greatly, not only from her recent confinement, but from cold and privations endured in one of the houses of refuge on Mount Cenis, where she had been sheltered during a storm for nearly three whole days. Jarring discords between herself and her hus- band, Signor Poggi (which terminated shortly afterwards in a separation), and consequent distress of mind, contributed likewise to deteriorate a voice which had been pre-eminently beautiful when heard a few months previously. The mind and ""school"" of the great artist were no longer adequately seconded by her physical powers. The fine intention still remained; but the full means for consummate execution were wanting. As it was, when the influence of the vieille garde and its numerous adherents, as well as the conservative tendency of the English public, are taken into account, it is manifest that the really great talent of Madame Frezzolini alone enabled her to maintain such a position as she actually did acquire.  She achieved, however, notwithstanding these untoward circumstances, many a legitimate triumph during the season.  Her first appearance was made in ""Beatrice di Tenda,"" an opera which, although it contains some of Bellini's sweetest melodies, and was supported on this occasion by both Ronconi and Guasco, failed to make a very favourable impression.  The libretto of ""Beatrice di Tenda,"" dark, lugubrious, and painful, is in itself calculated to impress an English audience unfavourably. Nevertheless, in this opera, Ronconi completely established himself, both as singer and actor. Poggi, who had unwisely refused the tenor part, writhed with jealousy to hear Guasco invariably encored in the ""Io Soffru"", a melody which, it may be noticed, bears a considerable resemblance to the tender composition by Reissiger, known as ""Weber's last Waltz.""",False,"The passage does not address or answer the scenario described.

Of course I did nothing of the sort; in the first place, I had nothing to practise, for I certainly had no intention of learning any of the really dreadful drawing-room pieces with which the piano was covered. Occasionally I played through one of them, for I read music quite easily. How I jibbed at the “Prière d’une Vierge”!

I had such frightful attacks of low spirits in that dreary back room that I never think of it without horror. After some months I began to connect music itself with those four walls and those hideous tenth-rate compositions which lay in bilious green and yellow covers on the top of the piano, and it seemed to me that my own love of music was being slowly poisoned to death.

Incapacity and indifference reached their climax with the disgraceful and humiliating scene that occurred at Her Majesty's Theatre on the night of March 6, 1886.

But the crisis had only been deferred. After the curtain had fallen again there was another long ""wait,"" and the disturbances recommenced. At length, in response to deafening calls, the stage-manager came forward and announced that it was impossible to proceed.

Sivori was still alive, and, like the majority of artists who lead the lives of virtuosi, had made Paris his home. I determined to do myself the honor of calling on him, and had an opportunity to do so in company with a Boston friend who knew him well. Sivori was living on the fourth or fifth story of a very modest hotel, having a single room, with space for an upright piano and an alcove for his bed. It was a charming, cosy little room, just such a one as the majority of bachelor artists occupy in Paris, no matter how ample their income; and in these quarters they receive the visits of princes and people of the haute noblesse. I let my friend, who was intimate with Sivori, do the talking for some time, while I watched all the artist’s motions. He was a rather small-sized man, and had very small hands for a violinist, at which I marvelled, for his distinction was based on his being a Paganini player; and we all know that the music of that composer requires the fingers of a prestidigitator. As we progressed in our call I nudged my friend (according to previous agreement) to tell Sivori I was a member of the Mendelssohn Quintette Club of Boston, and that I wanted very much to see the famous “ Strad,” the inheritance from Paganini. Sivori was amiability itself. […] Sivori took out the violin from its case. It was a perfect “ Kohinoor ” of an instrument, just the right color, and perfectly preserved,— not a scratch or a crack,—with the great seal of red sealing-wax on the under part of the violin where the neck begins. I told Mr. Sivori that I heard him in his first concert given in the old Masonic Temple in Boston (where R. H. Steams &amp; Co.’s store now is), that I was an enthusiastic boy at the time, and that his playing had made such an impression on me that I could name the pieces he played in that concert, though there was an interim of about forty years. I named them,—the E-flat concerto (his own composition), La Campanile by Paga¬nini, and the Most in Egitto, also by Paganini. The old artist opened his bookcase, took out a book containing an itinerary of musical tourndes made in his younger days, and turned at once to Boston. I had named the pieces exactly, and he was highly pleased. He played for us a great deal, and it was a joy to hear the tone of that violin; it was also impossible not to be affected by the sentiment connected with it. Paganini’s violin! the instrument of that strange and wonderful player, the wizard of the concert stage, who had conquered all musical Europe",False,"The passage does not address or answer the scenario of characterizing children's experience of music in bibliographic and artistic sources.

http://data.open.ac.uk/led/lexp/1448277167610,"These [Musikvereins Euterpe] concerts are similar to the celebrated Gewandhaus Concerts. They are held in a somewhat smaller room, and at a small subscription price, and are given only once in two weeks. The orchestra consists of about sixty talented musicians, and if Dreyschock and David are not seen leading the violins here as at the Gewandhaus, they, together with the other instruments, string and wind, are in the hands of artists of deservedly high reputation. The selections are also of the highest order, and the Euterpe presents its patrons with the works of the great masters in a style worthy of a Leipzig concert. At a quarter of an hour before the time of commencement, the members of the orchestra were in their places, talking, tuning and getting ready. This, together with the general conversation of the people assembled, produces a buzzing chorus of great power — a chorus with which the Leipzig concerts commence. Every ticket was sold at an early hour, and of course every seat was occupied. The concert commenced precisely at the hour appointed, with a new Sinfonie in E flat Major, in manuscript, by W. Westmayer, who conducted the performance. He is a young candidate for fame, who has been educated at the Conservatory here, and who is regarded as already a successful composer. The Sinfonie consisted of four parts, and occupied in its performance exactly thirty-eight minutes. I dare not attempt anything like a particular description of it, or comparison of it with other like compositions; it was listened to with good attention by a discriminating audience, and met a favorable reception. It seemed to me, however, to want light and shade, and variety in the treatment of the different subjects introduced. Parts of it were exceedingly interesting, considered in reference to modern combinations and contrasts of the different orchestral elements, but there was a too constant forte, and a too frequent reiteration of the tonic and dominant harmony, with brass instruments, in military rhythm — this, indeed, is a general resort of such composers as are sometimes at a loss for an idea, or in a similar condition with the public speaker who is obliged to speak, but has nothing in particular to say. I do not mean that Mr. Westmayer was minus thought, but still there was not such a flow as we often find in a Mozart. The Sinfonie was truly good, and seemed to give much satisfaction — and yet I could not help thinking that it was an excellent preparation for the high appreciation of the next orchestral piece, which was no less an overture than the celebrated No. 2, C Major, to Leonore, and which was given with an effect far beyond what can be often heard. The overture by C. M. Von Weber, to Oberon, was also played with such an energy and brilliancy as to take one’s breath away. The stillness of the pianos, the gradual and immense range of the crescendos, the thundering power of the fortes, with instantaneous contrasts and startling sfortzandos, were enough to work up the feelings to a perfect phrenzy. Wonderfully effective were these ever favorite overtures by Beethoven and Weber. It was no small attraction of this concert that the piano forte was played by the Fraulein Maria Wieck, the sister of the celebrated Clara, wife of Robert Schumann. Mdlle. Wieck is a very superior player; she has not the strong hand of a DeMeyer or a Listz, but she has a most finished touch, and plays with great elegance and expression. Her first piece (hear it, oh ye of the exclusive modern school,) was nothing more nor less than Dussek’s 12th Concerto in E fiat major, the Adagio and Allegro movements of which she played — a most beautiful composition, elegant and tasteful in the highest degree, played both by the principal and by the orchestra as near perfection as such things can be done. There is nothing in the music to astonish, or to excite wonder or surprise, but there is that in it which is adapted to call forth perfect delight. It is full of peace, and innocence, and purity, and joy, and it is from beginning to end a constant appeal to the perception of the beautiful. I am no enemy to the modem school; it is indispensable to an accomplished pianist, and every well-educated musician will delight in it; but they err who suppose that in Clementi and Cramer and Dussek and Pleyel, there is nothing good or worth being saved. The fact is, the pianists, previous to him who is generally regarded as the head of the great modern school, had worked out a very satisfactory solution of the problem of piano forte playing, or certainly so if considered with reference to the more natural and legitimate powers of the instrument. Thaiberg, Listz, and others, have certainly much enlarged the boundaries, or the available capacities of the piano, but some of their followers have gone to extremes; so much so that there has seemed to be danger of losing altogether the ordinary effects of piano forte playing, or that they would he swallowed up in the extraordinary feats of left-hand melodies, flights of octaves, and the various methods by which amazement and wonder are excited. Thanks for the signs of returning soberness and good sense; we greatly mistake if other authors like Dussek are not yet to be brought back to the concert room, and to the parlor, to fill with delight the spirit of the true lover of music, and of the most beautiful of all keyed instruments, the piano forte. A word to another class. There are some who condemn altogether the modern school, and who seem to suppose that all true musical genius left the world with Haydn and those of his day. Fraulein Wieck is not of their number, for while she played Dussek, in the first part of the concert, she played not Thalberg, or Listz, or DeMeyer in the second part, but Pagannini! Yes, the Carnival of Venice, arranged for the piano, and if music pleased legitimately in Dussek, the Fraulein excited no small degree of feeling by her exquisite touch, and facility of execution in the composition of the Prince of violinists. What if it be mere trickery; a dexterous artifice will always, at least, call forth admiration, and one does not always want to sit in sober judgment; and decide on the grounds of intrinsic musical merit — relaxation must be indulged, the beautiful give way to the ornamental, and true pleasure to mere amusement. If there is a time for all things, surely there is room enough for the old and new school of piano forte playing — yes, and for both schools of organ playing too, although this is not the place to dwell upon the latter. There was still another interesting feature in the Euterpe Concert — it was the singing of Mdlle. Louise Wolfl. She sang an air from Stradella by Flotow, and also two German songs, the latter by Franz Schubert.

It was soon, however, discovered that I had an agreeable voice and taste for singing; and in the sort of gay life we led (for my mother was always fond of society), this talent of mine was frequently called into play to enliven our tea-parties and suppers.

A principal point of attraction is always found in the Symphony, and on this occasion it was not a Mozart, a Beethoven, or a Mendelssohn, but an original manuscript composition of a member of the Orchestra, Ferd. Hermann, that was performed. Herr Hermann directed his own Symphony. It did not meet with a very warm reception, though sufficiently so to afford good encouragement to the author and his friends. There is always so much caution and incredulity, and sometimes suspicion, envy and jealousy abroad, that the path to fame, even to true merit, is rough and beset with difficulties. Our author, we suppose, could not complain of the manner in which his work was received, and probably a young composer does not often obtain greater approbation. There were undoubtedly fine points in the Symphony, indicating talent, taste and judgment. Its themes were concise and clear, and there seemed to be a considerable degree of the effusion of genuine feeling, without dry detail, commonplace thoughts, or tedious repetitions. The instrumentation was quite well balanced, though the Oboe was, perhaps, somewhat too prominent in the melodic passages; a greater variety of coloring in this respect might be an improvement. The thoughts were easy, natural and chaste, but yet never so striking as to call forth a rapturous or involuntary exclamation of delight or applause. The interest too was well sustained through the four movements, and although we suppose that the critics will not allow to this Symphony a higher place than mediocrity, yet the young author may be well contented with the award bestowed, return to his study, and try again. Signor Stigelli, a Tenor, from the Royal Italian Opera, London, sang with approbation; Carl Deichmann, a Violinist, from Hanover, played with entire success, a Concerto, by Vieux Temps; an aria by Julius Rietz, (Conductor,) was charmingly sung by Miss Mayer, coming seemingly fresh from the heart, on the tones of a sweet voice.",False,The passage does not address or answer the scenario as it does not mention anything specific about children's experience of music or provide evidence of listening experiences.
http://data.open.ac.uk/led/lexp/1448311811907,"I attended service there [St Peter's Church, Leipzig] this afternoon. At the precise hour the organ prelude commenced; it continued two minutes, and the first Lied immediately followed. There was no introit, or introductory motette as in the Nicolai and Thomas churches. The choir consisted of three boys and two men; and beside these, the organist, another person walking about in the organ loft, and myself, there was but one person present — a goodly old lady; so that when the service commenced, the congregation in fact consisted of but one woman. It reminded me of the clergyman who, when he had no one present but the clerk, took the liberty to alter the prescribed form of the service, reading not “Dearly beloved brethren” but “Dearly beloved Roger.” Here was an occasion then, when the singing was indeed congregational. The members of the choir were all singing, the old lady appeared to sing, and I joined the general chorus. The organ was full and made up for any deficiency of vocal power. I observed that in some stanzas the voices commenced without the organ, and sung three or four syllables, when they were joined by the full organ; though in some other stanzas the voices and organ were simultaneous in their commencement. This, however, can have nothing to do with that which we sometimes call expression or the adaptation of the tune to the different stanzas of the hymn, for no attention whatever is paid to this subject here; there is no variation of soft and loud, but every stanza is loud, and is apparently sung and played without the slightest reference to the principle above mentioned. Indeed the principle of adaptation (as generally understood by us in the United States), seems not to belong to the Congregational style of singing. The minister, who was not present at the commencement of the service, came in during the singing of the last stanza, faced the cross upon the altar for a few moments, and then turning towards the people (by this time numbering perhaps between twenty or thirty), he commenced the responsive chanting service. His first sentence is confined to about half a dozen words, which are given in the tones three and five of the scale; this being responded to by the choir, the minister chants quite a long sentence, after which the choir respond Amen. The response closed upon five of the scale, ascending to it by the sharp four — thus five, three, sharp four, five. After this the minister read about two minutes — the people rising. This was followed by the organ, and another hymn. The minister retired the moment he had finished reading (prayer) and was not present during the singing that followed; but at the close of the hymn, as before, he came in and read a scriptural lesson; again he retired, and again the organ announced another choral. By this time some fifty or sixty persons had assembled, and they succeeded in raising quite a chorus. At the close of the last stanza the minister appeared, not at the altar, but in the pulpit, and after half a dozen words of prayer, commenced his sermon. And now the choir, three boys and two men, took their turn in going out; as the minister seemed to have nothing to do with their part of the service, so, I suppose, they were alike relieved when he began to preach. Considering myself by profession and long habit as more nearly allied to choristers than preachers, and especially as I could not understand what was said, and as I could retire without being noticed, and without disturbing others, 1 followed their example.",False,This passage does not directly address or provide evidence of children's experience with music.

This invitation was the result of a strong conviction on the part of Niebuhr of the propriety of making such a demonstration of respect, both to his countrymen and to the grandees of Rome, and to the diplomatic body ; and having once made up his mind to do this, the fete was carried out with grand effect, the locality having the advantage, ever belonging to Roman palaces, of suitable space. A fete of the ordinary kind, either with dancing, or a performance of theatrical music, was felt to be too incongruous with the character and taste of the great historian, to be admissible; moreover, it was wholly unsuited to the serious aspect of a house and family, over which the ill-health of Madame Niebuhr cast a continual shadow. In the difficulty of selection of a means of giving object and character to the invitation of a mixed multitude, Bunsen's original suggestion was gladly accepted by Niebuhr, who obtained the assent of Consalvi in the name of the Pope, while Bunsen negotiated on his part with Baini, the selection of singers and of pieces ; in which last the judgement of Kocher was also consulted : and the Missa Papae Marcelli (an early and comparatively cheerful and popular work of Palestrina), the anthem ' Tu es Petrus' (belonging to the Papal Corona tion service, also by Palestrina), and the grand Dies irae (of Pittoni, somewhat later than Palestrina), were chosen as being most effective.

The service commenced by an organ voluntary; and a lighter, more frivolous piece of organ-playing, I never heard. It was an attempt at a kind of extemporaneous overture with fancy stops, flute, oboe, &amp;c., and great organ contrasts, staccato passages, sudden pianos, and fortes, and sforzandos, in little scraps of melody, light as the lightest of Donizetti or Verdi, without dignity, solemnity, character, or sense. Not a particle of reverence about it. I have heard the organ abused before, and degraded enough, but this was the climax of organ absurdity and degradation. In the chanting the children kept together, and there was the entire absence of that drawling in the cadences, so common in America. The notes in the cadences were very quickly sung — very much quicker than I have been accustomed to teach them, yet not too quick. But little attention was given to words — they were not properly delivered; but the smaller words were omitted, and many were so clipped or abridged as to be decidedly coarse or vulgar, as ""Glory be t' 'he Father,"" &amp;c. ""As 't was 'n th' beginning,"" &amp;c. This was particularly observable in the monotone recitation of the Lord’s Prayer and Creed. The Te Deum was sung in anthem form, and was well done — i.e. they all kept together, pronouncing the words with the speed of an auctioneer, but without any attention to sense, emphasis, pause, and the like. A strange psalm tune was sung. It was like an andante allegretto, with marked time, by Haydn. Strange indeed, to hear a hymn so sung to music so very light and inappropriate. But it was well done, that is, they all went through it together, as true as a factory wheel goes round, and with as much expression and good taste. In the place of an anthem, an extract from the Messiah was sung. Rec. “For behold darkness,” &amp;c.; aria, “ The people that walked,” and the chorus “For unto us.” The bass song was well done, by a fine voice, and in quite an artistic manner. The singer did himself much credit indeed, but the chorus was a failure — the little things (children) kept along and got through with it, but no character was given to it whatever. It is not children’s music. Children might as well be required to read Shakspeare, as to sing Handel. They may hit the tones, but they cannot sing the music. The organ accompaniment was here excellent — orchestra style was required, and orchestra style was played. The staccato was boldly, cleanly, and most distinctly given. Indeed the organ was made a most excellent substitute for an orchestra; and very great skill indeed was manifested by the organist.",True,"The passage describes children's experience of music in the London Foundling Hospital, where they are involved in singing and performing music.

Such morning concerts are quite common in the larger German cities. An individual, having the means to do it, employs at his own expense an orchestra, or more probably a quartet, or quintet, makes out his own programme, and invites his friends to spend a couple of hours in listening to fine music. On the present occasion, an audience of perhaps two hundred persons (the most musical people of Frankfort) were brought together. Schindler, the biographer of Beethoven, Schmidt the pianist, and other distinguished persons, were present. The concert consisted of both vocal and instrumental music; and Music’s sister, Elocution, was also brought in, and lent her aid in the exercises of the occasion. The programme contained the following pieces (though not in the order in which they are here put down), viz.:—  Quintet (G. minor), Mozart, charmingly — I suppose it may be, said, perfectly played by Messrs. Wolff, Baldenecker, Posch, Drinnenberg, and Siedentopf. Quintet Movement, Mozart. This very beautiful movement by Mozart has not before been played since the year 1783. It has been recently discovered in Mozart’s own hand-writing, among his manuscripts, which for some twenty years have been in the family of André of Offenbach. It will shortly be published. Recitative and Air, with violoncello and obligato accompaniment, composed by John Sebastian Bach. This song is quite of a popular character, notwithstanding it is by Bach, reminding one somewhat of Handel’s most popular songs. It is a sacred song, from an unpublished cantate; but the Recitative and Song will soon be published. Part-Songs, for soprano, alto, tenor, and bass. Two songs were sung by a well-trained double quartet. A Poem on Mozart was well read by a lady, having a rich alto voice, Fraulein Gräemann. The effect of introducing this elocutionary exercise was very pleasing, and the example is a good one to be followed wherever a really excellent reader can be found to sustain the part. Strangers are sometimes invited to play in these concerts; and on the present occasion two pianoforte pieces, “Amitie pour amitie,” composed by the performer, and Doneyschock’s Rhapsodie in C.

Evidently I didn’t look quite normal, for she asked me what was the matter.

http://data.open.ac.uk/led/lexp/1469630878700,"Sunday morning (St. Peter’s Day) The beautiful choral service at All Souls’, or the Hook Memorial Church [....]  The chants used for the Te Deum and Benedictus, though excellent as music, did not, especially the former, exactly suit the meaning and expression of the words ; exempli gratia, in the verse, “Thou did’st open the Kingdom of Heaven to all believers,” and again, “ Thou sittest at the right hand of God: in the glory of the Father,”—surely such words as these should not be sung to a minor, but to a bright major strain. The Venite and Psalms for the day (139, 140, and 141) were sung to chants by Frost, Turle, and Barnby—of which Turle’s was by far the best, whilst Barnby's is pretty and rather secular. The singing of the Psalms was admirable throughout—time, tune, clear enunciation, and considerable expression being alike to be admired and commended. The sweet, clear voices of the boys, led by Masters Holliday, Umpleby, Dodds, and Heath, and the sonorous tones of the basses here came out with telling effect, especially in the unison verses, of which I should like to have heard more. Again, the congregation joined with the choir, adding another proof that in such churches as the Hook Memorial, people go now to church to worship for themselves, and not to listen to a substitute like the old defunct parish clerk. When the Psalm says “ Come, let us sing,” the congregations of these days believe in the Psalm, and will not read, nor will they permit any substitute to read or sing for them. It is, therefore, most important, as Mr. Hird knows, that the chants should all be carefully selected, choosing those which have plain, simple melodies and pure, strong chords, which form the chain of church harmony, and, above all, avoiding such as have high reciting notes, or commencing on the major third above C the third space in the treble, and florid phrases. There is one point, however, in chanting the Psalms, which I venture to think the congregation would do well to observe, and that is to sing antiphonally with the choir, instead of joining with both sides, decani and cantoris. To accomplish this properly it might be desirable that most of the congregation should possess Psalters with the sides the choir take marked therein. The musical voice of the congregation was heard at its best in singing the hymns. There they asserted their right and their power, and occasionally with so much vigour that the organist had to bring out the full power of his instrument to support the united voices of the choir and people. With rare exceptions all the hymns are selected from the popular “ Ancient and Modern ” collection, wherein there is much that is good, and certainly a sprinkling of that which is not good. But why take the tunes quite so fast ? There is a via media in most things, and such a chorale as St Ann's loses much of its dignity and grandeur when sung at the speed it was—especially if wedded to majestic words like—“The Son of God goes forth to war.” One of the hymns (No. 436, “ Gloria ”), good as it is for harmony, will, oddly enough, be found by any musical person to contain melodic phrases exactly like those in the old English song, “ The Vicar of Bray.” There was both a Processional and a Recessional Hymn, the effect of these with such a large choir, well supported by the congregation and organ, being remarkably fine and impressive. Many conscientious persons object to these Processional and Recessional Hymns, but it must be remembered that it was an ancient custom of the Church, and not only so, but is in itself an act of praise and worship that gives tone, reverence, and solemnity to the beginning and ending of the services. The original use of the cathedral nave was that of preaching to the people, and walking up and down therein singing proces¬sional hymns. Soon after the Reformation the union of walking and singing fell into disuse, and as the people did not hear or did not relish what they heard, the pulpit was removed into the choir, and the nave became a sheepfold, without shepherd and without sheep. Thanks to the awakened spirit of the times, and to the example set by churches like our Parish Church and All Souls’, the nave of cathedrals has been restored to its original use. The Versicles, Preces, Litany, etc., are sung to what is called “ Hill’s Service ”—a modification of the ancient Durham Use, introduced into our Parish Church service when Mr. James Hill was choir-master, during the first part of Dr. Hook’s reign ; but they have been discontinued for some time, and those by the immortal Tallis, of Queen Elizabeth’s time, used instead. The former are comparatively weak, mostly in minor cadences, and are generally dragged by the choir, who sink in pitch considerably, especially in the Litany, which, by the way, was admirably intoned by the vicar, the Rev. Cecil Hook, the other parts being sung by the preacher, the Rev. B. R. Wilson. The organ voluntaries and accompaniments were throughout admirably played by Mr. Hird, whose good taste and technique were always apparent and acceptable. The March which he played at the conclusion of the service, and which he contributed some years ago to The Organist's Quarterly Journal, served at once to display his ability both as a composer and an executant.",False,The passage does not provide any information or evidence related to children's experience of music.

It was listened to by 19,000 persons; and never do I remember having heard this glorious oratorio performed with so much power and legitimate effect as on this occasion. The blemishes were so slight that they ought not to be alluded to. The difficulties of the work were overcome with ease by the three or four thousand singers, who had been divided into two grand choirs, and whose individual, as well as united endeavours, produced the most gratifying and satisfying performance. From the beginning of the expressive chorus, “ And the children of Israel sighed,” to the song of Miriam, “ I will sing unto the Lord,” with its continued iteration of Divine glory and judgment, there was an enchanting succession of musical triumphs, never to be obliterated from the heart's tablet of a grateful listener. “ He spake the word ” came out from the army of basses in a unisonous tone of sustained thunder; indeed, the choral power was so overwhelming as to swamp entirely sometimes the rapid demi-semiquaver accom-paniments of the violins, etc. The effect of the “ Hailstone Chorus ” was really overwhelming; and here, again, the giant¬like roll of the basses, and the crashes of chords on the words, “fire,” “hail,” etc., electrified the audience, who insisted upon its repetition. Then that wonderful instance of word-painting, u He sent a thick darkness,” with its sustained chords by the strings and its chromatic progressions for the voices, could only be equalled for its fine execution by the supreme excellence of “ He smote all the firstborn of Egypt ” and “ He led them forth like sheep,” the softly-sustained G’s and D’s in the latter, so delicate and pastoral, being worthy of refined solo singing. But I refrain from saying more, lest my enthusiasm for this noble work by Handel—for it is his as it stands, whatever hypercritics may say of the source of some of his themes—should lead me to weary the reader with any long-drawn out disquisition or critical analysis. The whole work left a deep impression upon my mind, and 1 recall it only to regret that one cannot oftener participate in the musical glory of such a magnificent performance. “ God save the Queen ” having been given with overwhelming effect, loud and well-deserved cheers arose for Sir Michael Costa, who returned to the orchestra to acknowledge the compliment, which had been so heartily and spontaneously accorded to him. Mr. Willing was an efficient organist, and M. Sainton, as chef-ctattaque, rendered good service throughout the Festival; and, with the tender of my best thanks for the kind attention of Mr. Gardiner and the stewards of the Sacred Harmonic Society, I take my leave of the recent Handel Festival, and the pleasant week’s enjoyment it brought in its train, with grateful remembrance, and a hope that we may be spared to participate in many more similar gatherings, and with the same gratifying result.",False,"The passage does not address or answer the scenario described.

The style was new; at least it was unconventional and probably daring, for I really hardly knew what I was about. The Air was listened to in dead silence, half out of curiosity no doubt; but a burst of applause followed the last die-away notes. I plunged into the variations; I felt my execution slovenly and beneath my usual mark; but I was more than once interrupted by applause, and at the close of the next cantabile movement of extreme beauty, which I played better a sort of meditation on the original air the enthusiasm rose to fever pitch; men stood up in the distant gallery and waved their caps, and I remained holding my violin, unable to proceed with the last rapid variation. When silence was restored I played this atrociously; I hardly played it at all, it was quite wild. STERNDALE BENNETT, seeing that it was all up with me that night, hurried and banged it through anyhow; but the critical faculty of the room was gone, so was my head; I had won by a toss, and although then, and often afterwards, owing to neglect of practice, I was frequently not up to my own mark, my position as solo violinist at the University Concerts was never disputed up to the time that I took my degree.",False,"The passage focuses on the author's personal experience as a solo violinist at the Cambridge Musical Society during their time at university.

It was an old ballad, which I had heard once before : — 'Say, have you in the village seen A lonely youth, of pensive mien? If such a one hath passed by, With melancholy in his eye, Where is he gone ? Ah, tell me where! Tis Allan Brook, of Windermere.'  It was sung by Miss Jane. Her pensive look, and the soft accents of her voice, enchanted me. The spell, however, was suddenly broken by the wine- drinkers bursting into the room. They had listened to the song, and begged to hear it again. The Captain, however, with good taste, called upon his daughter to sing him his favourite : —  ""In the world's crooked path where I've been, There to share of life's gloom my poor part, The bright sunshine that softened the scene Was a smile from the girl of my heart.""  This was loudly applauded.I had crept into a corner during this interval, when my fair one asked me to sing. I was aware that nothing tender or sentimental would please at this moment, and I hit upon the convivial strain which Purcel sang to Charles the Second [...] The merriment was silenced by a flash of lightning, and the large drops of rain drove the ladies from the verandah.",False,The passage does not provide any information specifically related to children's experience of music.

The subject of the fugue was, perhaps, a little too chromatic for the dignity of worship, but it was played slowly and with great precision and certainty. At the close of the voluntary, the minister, followed by the session, entered; the former took his place in the pulpit; the latter took their places in seats appropriated to them, on each side, facing the congregation. The organ then gave out the tune Iosco — the melody was made very prominent, the bass was played by the pedals, and an intermediate figured accompaniment filled up the harmony, producing a fine effect. The hymn, the subject of which was prayer to Jesus for his spirit, was finely sung by the whole assembly, all singing the melody. At the end of the first line of the last stanza, which was doxological, the minister rose in the pulpit, not to find his place in the Bible as if he was in a hurry to cut off the last act of praise, but apparently as an act of reverence, as he kept standing, without any movement, and was soon followed in his example by all the male part of his congregation. A short prayer followed the hymn; then an address (extempore) of four or five minutes; after this the regular morning prayer was read; another hymn was sung as before, and the sermon followed. There were two hymns sung afterwards, making four times singing during the exercises. Here was a very simple, appropriate, devotional service for a Sabbath morning, — almost the same, indeed, as is the religious service in our Presbyterian, Baptist, or Congregational churches, and vastly superior to the Lutheran or English Cathedral repetitions and forms.",False,"The passage does not provide any information or evidence related to children's experience of music.

That has happened to music in Italy, which happens to language and style, to poetry and painting, and indeed to every thing else in this world. When a certain point of perfection has been attained, the progress afterwards is in a contrary direction; and a corruption of taste is introduced by the very attempt to pursue improvement beyond that line, which limits all human exertion by the irreversible fiat;—"" thus far shalt thou go, and no farther."" But though music must be considered as on the decline in Italy, there is, notwithstanding, a general diffusion of musical taste and musical talent, extending to the lowest ranks. I have often set my window open at night to listen to the ""dying falls"" of a favourite air, distributed into parts, and sung by a party of mechanics returning home from their work, with a degree of skill and science that would not have disgraced professional performers. The serenade is a compliment of gallantry, by no means confined to the rich. It is customary for a lover, even of the lowest class, to haunt the dwelling of his mistress chanting a rondo, or roundelay, during the period of his courtship.  One of these swains infested our neighbourhood, and my Italian master caught the words, which were pretty enough.",False,The passage does not address or answer the scenario's question about characterizing children's experience of music in primary sources.
http://data.open.ac.uk/led/lexp/1448276340407,"I have this evening had an opportunity of attending one of the famous subscription concerts in this city, known as the Gewandhaus Concerts. The concert room is not large, but convenient, and good for musical effect. The centre of the room is occupied by ladies, and the outer seats mostly by gentlemen. A narrow gallery, in which are a number of private boxes, runs round the room. The first object of attraction, after entering the room, is a fine large medallion of Mendelssohn, back of the orchestra; there is no other bust or picture in the room. It makes one feel sod when looking at this fine representation of the great modem composer, in the very room where he has been, and still is, so highly appreciated, and where he has so often triumphed gloriously, to think that he was cut off in his youth, and that the musical world, after so short a time of enjoyment, was deprived of the talents and learning of one who promised to do for music, perhaps, more than any man living. At almost every concert, more or less of his music is performed; his memory is cherished, not only here, where he was so well known, but by all the musical world, and his name shall be held in everlasting remembrance. A crowd of people were waiting round the door, when we arrived; and, although it was an hour before the time for the performance to commence, the room was filled, (save the reserved seats in the gallery,) in a few minutes after the door was opened. One must be on hand at an early hour to get a good seat. In about half an hour the members of the orchestra began to make their appearance, and as all the people in the house were talking loud, so the musicians, as they came in, one after another, began to tune, to try their instruments, and to amuse themselves by running over the scales; so that by the time they were all there, thus employed, the room was filled with sound; the more so because, as the musicians began to exercise themselves upon their instruments, the talking and laughing grew louder and louder, and at a quarter of an hour before the commencement of the music, it was a perfect Babel in the concert room, and as difficult to hear one speak as it is in a railroad car, with all the windows open, in summer. But a few minutes before the hour, the room began to grow quiet, musical expectation began to awaken, and when, as the precise moment arrived, the conductor’s signal was heard, everything was still, and perfect silence took the place of noise and confusion. Another signal, and the whole band, as one man, were heard interpreting and presenting to a most attentive audience, one of the great works of the immortal Beethoven. It was the Sinfonie No. 8, F major. This is not regarded as one of Beethoven’s greatest triumphs; but, although it is light and playful, it abounds in each of its four movements, with the most fanciful and imaginative melodic figures, contrapuntal points, and instrumental contrasts. Ever lively and ever new, it never tires, but holds one in a kind of musical ecstasy from beginning to end; there seems to be no place where one can relax attention, or cease to be filled with musical delight; so that at the close of each part, a good long breath naturally comes in as a relief; and one becomes conscious of the intensity of the application he has been giving to the discourse. The very first thing which strikes one, on hearing such an orchestra as this, is the perfect oneness of the violins. They do, indeed, constitute a perfect chorus — ten or more persons are playing the first violin, and as many more the second; but they are all artists, and, therefore, each one loses himself; no one is heard above the others; but all so beautifully blend as to constitute one perfect whole. This is the perfection of a chorus, be it vocal or instrumental; and this effect is produced by the Gewandhaus Orchestra. Another point, immediately noticed, is the proper proportion of wind and stringed instruments; but perhaps the most striking point, as contrasted with our American orchestras, is the perfection of the wind instruments. It is too often the case in our orchestras that some wind instrument is wanting; thus the oboe or the faggotto is often missing; and again, it is not unfrequently the case that, although there may be some one to hold these or other instruments in the hand, or up to the sight of the audience, a tone is seldom permitted to escape from them; they are seen but not heard, Not so here; every instrument is not only represented to the eye, but is in the hands of a master who makes it speak to the ear. The consequence is, that such combinations fall upon the ear as are not heard with us. The brass instruments too are made to tell their story without any impediment of speech; whereas, with us, they stutter, or falter, or hem, or cough, to the no small disturbance of the equilibrium of one’s temper. We do not know that in this concert every instrument is played in all respects right; we do not know but some notes may have been omitted, or wrong tones produced, but certain are we that we did not discover any such imperfections. There are four things, (technical points,) that we have seldom heard well exhibited elsewhere, which were exceedingly well brought out here, viz.: Piano, Crescendo, Diminuendo and Fortzando. These, with the other technicals of playing were so well observed, that added to the pure tone peculiar to each particular instrument, and connected with a most perfect amalgamation or blending of all the different elements of the orchestra, they seemed to produce, not a mere musical performance to be listened to, but a living being, or moral, spiritual existence, capable of expressing the deepest feeling, and of calling forth the strongest sympathies of humanity. The Sinfonie being over, and a few moments for rest having been given, old Handel visited us in an Arie from his Opera “Aerio” — “Folle e colui che al tuo favor si fida.” It was sung by Herrn Salvatore Marchesi, who was the only vocalist for the evening. The song was well sung; but we sometimes hear quite as good singing across the Atlantic. Belletti is decidedly his superior. The third piece was a Flute Concerto; it was a tiresome affair. A Flute Concerto is a Flute Concerto, whether in the Gewandhaus, Hanover Square rooms, Tripler Hall or the Melodeon; and although it may not be always played by Herrn W. Haake, (who certainly did his duty well,) it is always the most dry and uninteresting of musical performances. In part 2d was given, 1st, the beautiful overture Echoes of Ossian, (often played in New York and Boston,) by N. W. Gade. 2d. Arie from Zauberflote, by Mozart, “Qui sdegno non s' accende."" 3d. Mendelssohn’s concerto for the piano forte, in D. Minor. 4th. Arie from Don Giovanni, by Mozart, “Madamina, il catalogo e questo,"" and 5th. The very fine overture to the opera, “Der Wassertrager,” by Cherubini. Gade’s overture may be regarded as a sacred piece. It speaks of greatness, and calls forth emotions of the sublime. Something like an Old Chorale pervades the whole, which seems to tell of worship, and to call forth humble adoration. With what grandeur this subject was given out, and oft in the course of the piece alluded to by the brass instruments, or exemplified and illustrated by the others, cannot be told. The overture is known with us, but it requires and deserves dose study. The Piano Forte Concerto, D (not G) Minor, failed for want of a performer; a highly promising young lad of the conservatory attempted it, but he had neither grasp of mind nor of hand enough for Mendelssohn. Herr Marchesi sang both airs well, gaining for himself decided applause. On the whole, here is a highly-talented and well-regulated orchestra. The conductor for the evening was Julius Rietz, well known to the musical world. I will mention one or two things about the audience: 1st. Gentlemen took off their hats before passing the door of the hall, all of them, without a single exception; and this, although they were there an hour before the performance commenced. There was not a single man standing under the galleries or near the doors, uncovered. The ungentlemanly act of standing or sitting in a concert room with hats on, could not be seen in the Gewandhaus. 2d. Ladies were all in full dress. 3d. There was silence during the performance of music. The moment the music ceased, then indeed there was a perfect buzzing of voices, and very loud talking all over the room; but at the signal for the commencement of the music, all was still; and we were not prevented from hearing the music by those whisperings, so annoying in some places. On the whole, this was a very fine concert; the orchestra playing was as near to perfection, I doubt not, as can often be found; and that constitutes the great attraction of the Gewandhaus. Every man seems to be able to play on his own instrument well; every man seems to give undivided attention to the music, and to endeavor to observe carefully, not only the time, as given by the conductor, but all those little gesticulations by which expression is indicated.",False,The passage does not provide any evidence or information about children's experience with music as witnessed in bibliographic and artistic sources. It mainly describes a concert experience and discusses the orchestra and audience behavior.
http://data.open.ac.uk/led/lexp/1448285563397,"The concert was given in the saloon of the Gewandhaus, by Robert and Clara Schumann. The conductor was Robert Schumann himself; the pianist was his wife. The orchestra was large, and the best that Leipzig could furnish. Robert Schumann has great celebrity, and especially in those cities where he has resided and has brought out his music under his own immediate direction. No one since Mendelssohn’s death stands so high in the estimation of the German musicians. There are places where he is not known, because his music is not understood; but even in these, and throughout Germany, he is regarded as standing at the very head of his profession, and no one commands aa. he does the universal attention of scientific men. Some go so far as to regard him as the greatest symphonist that has ever lived; but time can only determine this. The concert had been advertised for some time, and the expectations of the lovers of music were fully awake. Not only were the musicians and lovers of music of Leipzig present, but literary and scientific men of the various professions, and the beauty, and wealth, and fashion of the city came to do homage to talent of so high an order, and to learning so extensive. Like the people at Lystra, so here, they lifted up their voices, saying, not in the speech of Lycaonia, but in that of Saxony ""The gods are come down to us in the likeness of men.”  [...] But it was not only from this city that the audience was gathered on this occasion; it had been noised abroad that this concert was to be given, and musical men of high standing, Kapellmeisters and Concertmeisters, from the region round about, came up to Leipzig. Berlin, Dresden, Weimar, and other places were represented. At the head of this foreign company, and indeed at the head of the whole company, was Lis[zt];— the very Lis[zt] himself came from Weimar to listen, and to pay honor to greatness. But Robert Schumann is not alone, he has a “help meet” indeed. Clara Wieck was perhaps the most distinguished female pianist who has ever lived; and, unlike many ladies, she did not give up her instrument when she became Clara Schumann, but rather devoted herself with greater assiduousness under her new instructor, than she had previously done under the teachings of her father, to the profession which had been the choice of both her husband and herself. No wonder that the people should assemble on the occasion of a visit from this far-famed couple. But they came not to hear any one sing or play on an instrument, for although the wife is indeed a most accomplished pianist, yet the husband neither plays nor sings; but they rather came to hear the new music that the master had produced. They looked for some new musical revelation, for new chords (if possible), or new progressions; at least some new method of treatment, or harmonic development was expected. It was not to be the same tune over again. They went away satisfied; for, not only was the musical performance pronounced to be one of the very best, but the music, or the principal piece of attraction, was regarded as worthy of its author. The first piece was the “Overture zu L. Byron's Manfred von R. Schumann,"" This is an overture in the true learned German style, and as unlike the overtures of the modem Italian and French schools as can be imagined; of course, it cannot be popular, that is, it cannot take with the people generally; on this occasion, however, it was fully appreciated and listened to, by one of the most intelligent musical audiences that could be brought together in Germany, with unmingled delight. The second piece was “Concert No. 2, F moll, fur Piano Forte mit Begleitung des or Chester, von F. Chopin,” performed by Clara Schumann. This is said to be in Chopin’s peculiar style, and one of his most difficult productions. Mad. Schumann played it with apparent ease, and with a delicacy of touch and distinctness of articulation not to be excelled. She has not so great a power as some; in this respect she resembles Chopin himself, but in everything else requisite to the perfection of piano forte playing she is fully accomplished. The third piece was a song by Herr Behr, necessary for variety’s sake; after which Mad. Schumann played most charmingly two pieces- “Andantino von W. Sterndale Bennett"" and ""Lied ohne Worte (F major), von F. Mendelssohn Bartholdy.” The second part of the concert (and here was the attraction) consisted of “Die Pilgerfahrt der Rose” (the pilgrimage of the rose), a new composition for voices (solo and chorus) and orchestra by Robert Schumann. This has been performed here a week or two before, and was noticed in a previous communication. Anything like an analytical notice of it from one who has heard it but once or twice would hardly be expected, and in the present case it would be quite absurd. It will be known in a few years. The orchestra never played better; the idea of playing under Schumann inspired every man with new life and energy, and the improvement in the performance of the music under the direction of the composer (there having been a previous rehearsal also under his teaching), was said to be very apparent. We can hardly imagine a musical occasion that would be more interesting or exciting especially to the truly enlightened musician than this. For the few details here given we are indebted to others, for we did not attend this concert; we neither saw the sight nor heard the sound thereof. Why? It was given on Sunday Morning, March 14th, at 11 o'clock.",False,"The passage does not provide any evidence or information related to children's experience of music.

http://data.open.ac.uk/led/lexp/1448275407308,"This is a series of concerts for the people, at a low charge; the prices being four shillings, two shillings, and one shilling, according to the class of seats. They consist of vocal and instrumental music, but without orchestra. They employ some five or six solo performers, and a choir of about forty-five choristers. Glees and madrigals are sung by the choir, and songs, duets, &amp;c., by the solo voices, with piano forte pieces, violin pieces, or other instruments as it may be convenient to obtain for the different concerts. I attended the second of the series on Thursday last. The large Exeter Hall was full of people, who seemed to be much delighted with the music; indeed I thought that there was more warmth of approval exhibited there than we usually see at the best concerts with us. The solo performers were Miss Pyne, Miss Louisa Pyne, Miss Binckes, Mr. Swift, (a new tenor,) Herr Jonghmans, Mr. Cotton, and Mr. Whitworth. Miss Goddard played serenade (Don Pasquale), by Thalberg, and also an andante and rondo capricioso by Mendelssohn, on the piano forte, and Mr. Richardson played an air with variations on the flute. Miss Binckes has a very fine voice, and sung to the great acceptance of the audience, and Miss Louisa Pyne sung quite a difficult aria by Rode, which called forth a most enthusiastic encore. The pieces for full choir were performed without accompaniment, not even the piano forte being played; and although I have heard a better chorus at home, yet this was truly good. The concert was conducted by Mr. T. H. Severn. The programme contained the music to the National Anthem, printed in full in four parts, and the whole audience joined in this the closing chorus:   “God save our gracious Queen, Long may Victoria reign; God save the Queen! Send her victorious, Happy and glorious, Long to reign over us, God save the Queen!   ""O Lord our God arise, Scatter her enemies, And make them fall. Confound their politics, Frustrate their knavish tricks, On Thee our hopes we fix, God save us all.

http://data.open.ac.uk/led/lexp/1438189723317,"The final rehearsal for the opening concert of the festival took place at the Albert Hall on May 5. Wagner had himself chosen the programmes. He was to conduct each first part, consisting of selections from all his operas, from “Rienzi” to “Tristan""; while Hans Richter, who now made his first appearance in England, was to direct the excerpts from “Der Ring des Nibelungen"" that formed each second part. Most of the preliminary work had been done under Mr. Dannreuther, in whom Wagner reposed great confidence. All that remained was to give the finishing touches and for the composer-conductor to accustom himself to the vast auditorium and the huge crescent-shaped phalanx of orchestral players spread before him. From the outset, as it seemed to me, he failed to place himself en rapport with either. The abnormal conditions appeared completely to upset him. In a word, he succumbed there and then to a severe attack of Albert Hall stage fright— an illness familiar to nearly every artist on stepping for the first time upon the platform of that gigantic amphitheatre. However, after a glance of astonishment round the empty hall, and a few whispered words to Wilhelmj, and yet a few more to Hans Richter (who was posted beside the conductor's desk), the great man raised his baton and gave the signal for the start. The inaugural piece was the “Kaisermarsch,"" and it was well chosen for the purpose. Its pompous and sonorous strains, proceeding with stately rhythmical movement throughout, were perfectly calculated to show off the imposing volume of the big orchestra in such a building as that. It gave no trouble, and the effect was superb. But, unluckily, instead of imbuing Wagner with a little confidence, this preludial essay left him more palpably nervous than before.  The second piece on the list was the overture to the “Fliegende Hollander”. Here, I confess, I looked for something exceptional. I had always understood that Wagner was a fine conductor, at least of works with which he was in true sympathy, and I expected his reading of the “Dutchman"" overture to be in the nature of a revelation. Imagine, then, my disappointment and sorrow when it resulted in a complete breakdown! Twice—nay, thrice— did he make a fresh start, while Mr. Dannreuther and Mr. Deichmann (the faithful leader of the second violins) took it by turns to translate his complaints and instructions to the orchestra. But it was of no avail. He utterly failed either to indicate or to obtain what he wanted, and at last, in sheer despair, he threw down his stick and requested Richter to do the work for him. Well do I remember the sharp round of applause with which the band greeted the Viennese conductor as he mounted the rostrum. It was thoughtless—unkind, if you will; for it must have smote with unpleasant sound upon the ears of the sensitive composer. But the overture went without a hitch. It was played as I had never heard it played before.",False,"The passage does not address or answer the scenario described.

There was, in the performance of this choir, all the full, dear, and certain delivery and union of vocal tones that the most fastidious critic could desire; though less of the crescendo and diminuendo than in the Dom choir at Berlin; but in one respect, the Munich choir had a great advantage, — the Soprano and Alto parts were sustained by femail voices. Consequently, there was a fulness, richness, and maturity of voice, and a blending in the chorus; neither of which can be obtained in choirs where boys sing the Soprano.

A new Anthem, by Dr. Elvey, of Windsor, was sung, and also Mozart’s Twelfth Mass. The performance was decidedly poor — vastly inferior to the German choruses which we have recently described. The time was tolerably well kept, but tune was far enough from accuracy. The same feeling about for the pitch, and uncertainty of tone, was observable in the more difficult modulations, which is so common with our untrained New England choirs; with this difference, however, that we occasionally stop to correct a badly-intoned passage, whereas here it was passed over as if unobserved, or as if such a dissonant performance had become a matter of habit. There was, too, an absence of all those things that go to make up a good choral performance, as Forte and Piano, Sforzando, Syncopated accent, distinctness and clearness of vocal utterance, &amp;c. The leader would occasionally sing out at the top of his voice, “Piano,” but he did not seem to expect that attention would be given to what he said, and kept on, under a press of sail, until another opportunity should occur for calling out with like result. This was, indeed, a rehearsal; but if a choir is permitted to sing thus in rehearsal, will they not form habits that will prevent improvement, and will not the public performances be of the same general character? The violins were badly played. One could hardly help coming to the conclusion that they were mostly beginners, assembled for practice.

I can find no words to express my astonished delight when I saw the little fellow, only six years old, sit down to the pianoforte, and commence an extemporaneous performance, which baffles all description. His large dark eyes lighted up, his whole soul seemed intent upon what he was about, and yet with all this there was such a genuine childish simplicity. I could not say half of what I feel. I am afraid this will be thought an exaggeration, but I never was an admirer of wonderful children. I have seen many who had extraordinary execution upon an instrument, but God has given this child an intuitive knowledge of the most hidden mysteries of sound—a creative power perfectly organized that surpasses belief. Read the accounts of Mozart's infancy and you have read this child's, I sat down to the piano, and while his mother held him at a distance, I endeavoured to puzzle him by the most intricate modulations, but he not only instantly named the key I was playing in, but followed every change (even when an enharmonic transition rendered it almost inappreciable to the ear) with the rapidity of thought,—he knew it, but he knew not why. In the course of playing I struck the chord of the sharp 6th—the German 6th as called by some writers, and upon resolving it in the usual way he started up and cried out ""that is the sharp 6th in the key of C minor, and I can dissolve it another way."" He ran to the piano, and without a moment's hesitation struck the chord, and proceeded to resolve it in a most abstruse but perfectly correct manner, and then went on modulating till he brought it back to the original key. He played me numbers of the airs he had written, all distinguished by the exquisite taste and plaintiveness of their character, some marches loud and lively with an evident idea of orchestral effect in their arrangement ; indeed orchestral and dramatic effect pervades every note he plays. I can never forget the impression this scene made upon me. I am not ashamed to say that it affected me to tears.

The Court was present ; and an incident, independent of the great event of the evening, is worthy of record. It was the first appearance of the Queen in public, since the famous 10th of April, when English loyalty and English "" pluck "" had pretty clearly shown that England could have nothing to fear from the revolutionary elements which were just then rife in Europe, driving monarchs from their thrones. When the British Sovereign first reappeared among her subjects, loyalty was not to be baulked of a fitting de- monstration; and in spite of the etiquette of the day, which allowed the Queen, as well as her subjects, to enjoy a dramatic entertainment without interruption, she was received by such universal homage of acclamation, that she was constrained to appear in the front of her box to acknowledge the demonstration, whilst the the National Anthem was sung by the chief singers of the establishment.

No leading voice was heard; the organ alone seemed to lead, and yet the singing and the playing were so nearly together that no unpleasant effect was produced. It is always better that the organ should lead, than that a single voice should be heard ahead of others; but, there is, indeed, no necessity for either, even in Congregational singing, and the idea that a single voice should lead a choir by being always a little in advance in time, is so entirely at variance with good taste that it is not to be tolerated. The singing was in unison, and the times seemed to be perfectly familiar. The tune was not played over upon the organ before the singing, but the organist played only a prelude of a few measures, when all the people joined at once in the hymn. The interludes were very short; indeed, they could hardly be called interludes in the ordinary sense, since they were too short to include even a single phrase; they consisted only of a passing chord or two, merely allowing time to breathe between the stanzas.

http://data.open.ac.uk/led/lexp/1448287306770,"The first service commenced at 8 o’clock in the morning; and as the mornings are short and dark in the winter season, it requires some effort to be punctual. The church is a large one, and the stone walls and uncushioned seats are very cold, yet is there no fire found there, save the burning candles on the altar, which, though they shed some light around, afford no warmth. It is not a Papal, but a Protestant church; the Lutherans use the crucifix, candles, &amp;c., though less than the Romanists. There are two galleries, one rising high above the other, each capable of containing, perhaps, five hundred people; so that the church may accommodate, say three thousand, on its three floors. The organ is large, with three rows of keys, pedals, and fifty-four registers. The exercises commenced punctually at the hour, by a short prelude, played in fine organ style, but not more than about two minutes long. This was followed by a choir piece, sung without any accompaniment, by a choir of men and boys, and without much effect. The choir had not power sufficient for so large a building. An interlude of a few minutes upon the organ followed, when a chorale was sung by the congregation, accompanied with full organ. The congregation was not yet large, but the people were constantly coming in, and it was fast increasing. Still the effect of the general singing was quite animating. This being concluded, the minister began his part of the service, by chanting a short sentence, which was immediately responded to by the choir; and again the minister, and again the response. By this time the church was well filled. From an estimate that I made, I concluded that there could not be less than about twenty-five hundred people present. The organ loft, too, capable of accommodating, perhaps, a hundred, was completely filled with vocal and instrumental performers, including the common orchestral instruments, with trumpets and drums conspicuous. When the slow solemn chant was ended, the organ burst out in a loud minor voluntary, which continued three or four minutes, during which time the violins, violoncellos, double basses, and wind instruments tuned. Yet so carefully was this done, that it was hardly perceptible, for the organ was giving out its full progressive chords, so as to nullify the tuning process, at least upon the ears of the people. Tune being secured, the choir, with organ and orchestra accompaniment, sung a motette, or hymn by Beethoven. This had been announced in the newspapers of Saturday, and was, I suppose, with many an object of attention. It occupied, perhaps, fifteen minutes, and was very well done; the drums and trumpets especially doing fine execution in the great church in the forte passages. It closed with a short fugue, in which the points were distinctly taken up and marked. The choir did not number more than from thirty to forty persons, and had not sufficient power for the building; but still the performance was quite effective. I perceived that while most of the people gave close attention to the music, others were not so much interested, and one goodly-looking old man directly in front of me spent the time in reading over his psalm-book. As soon as the motette was concluded, the members of the orchestra took up their instruments and left the house, having nothing to do with the remaining service. And now came the grand singing — for the great congregation were now together. The organ gave out a choral, when all the people lifted up the loud chorus of praise. The whole house was filled with sound. It was sublime, and I found myself much more moved by this than by the previous choir and orchestra performance. The hymn (486) was indicated on tablets in different parts of the house, and every person had his book in his hand. Even the standers-up in the aisles (for there were hundreds of these) had their books and joined in the song. The singing was in unison; I could not tell, being at the opposite side of the house, whether the choir sang the parts or not; the organ did indeed pour forth full harmony, but even this was vastly overpowered by the multitude of voices — men’s voices, and women’s voices, and children’s voices, mingled in one mighty torrent of sound, rolling through the high arches like the rush of many waters. At the end of each line of the stanza there was an interlude of a few chords upon the organ, but there was no long interlude at the end of the stanza, as in the American churches. Indeed the hymn seemed to flow along from beginning to end, as a whole, and without interruption. I observed, too, that in the hymn-singing I heard in England, the interludes between the stanzas were very short, and often omitted altogether. A very pleasing effect was produced at the close of this and every choral hymn, thus: as soon as the voices ceased on the last word of the last stanza, every head was inclined forward as in the attitude of prayer, while the organ died away piano, in a very short post-lude of perhaps half or three-quarters of a minute, the people retaining their position until the last sound was heard, when they gently resumed an erect posture. After this followed liturgical prayers, read by the clergyman, for a few minutes; and then the chorale was resumed, another stanza or two of the same hymn being sung to the same chorale as before. After this followed the sermon. I did not understand it, but if one might judge by the appearance of the people, it was good, for they all seemed to give close attention for at least three-quarters of an hour. When the sermon was ended, and a short prayer offered, “Vater unser,” the hymn was resumed again, and still another stanza sung to the same tune as before; so that the same tune was sung three times in the same service. A closing prayer of a few words, and the great congregation gradually dispersed, amid the loud rolling of the diapasons.",False,The passage does not provide any evidence or information about children's experience with music.

The audience was hushed, attentive, a little awed, but intensely appreciative. I did not play myself. No one had heard me play there, so no one expected me to play then; and I might have lost my character as general manager and president had I contributed to the programme in a musical capacity. I confess the old war-horse within me began to chafe and paw the ground, impatient for action, when the players got well to work. I seemed to feel that my real place was at their side. I had been too lately weaned, but I kept my feelings to myself.  I believe in music as I believe in pictures for the masses. It draws people together, oils the wheels of the social system, and very much facilitates the intercourse between a pastor and his flock. Music is better than penny readings or lectures for this purpose, chiefly because penny readings, as a rule, are so badly and stupidly conducted. For one person who can attract attention by his reading or lecturing there are a dozen who can excite interest among the poorer classes by singing and playing; and professional musicians are, as a rule, very kind and liberal in giving their services if only a fit occasion presents itself.",False,The passage does not address the scenario of characterizing children's experience of music in bibliographic and artistic sources.

It is not indeed a new hall, but an old one repaired, painted, and ornamented; it is in the same house where Bach lived, and is the very room where Bach, Hiller and others labored and conducted musical performances. Hauptmann now occupies the same apartments which were formerly occupied by the great Fuguist. The exercises, with the exception of a short address by one of the pupils, were exclusively musical, as follows: I. Prayer. ""Kommet Lasset uns anbeten"", Hauptmann II. Motette. ""Der Geist hilft unserer Schwachheit, J.S. Bach III. Four part-songs:- 1. ""O Thaeler weit, o Hoehen"", Mendelssohn 2. ""O sanfter, suesser Hauch"", Mendelssohn (The above may be found in the ""Social Glee Book,"" and have been sung in the Boston Musical Conventions.) 3. ""Waldeinsamkeit"", Hauptmann 4. ""Ich stand auf, Berges Hoehen"", Hauptmann IV. Motette. ""Jauchzet dem Herrn"", Schicht. The singing was by the choir of the school and church, which consisted of about fifty voices; Soprano and Alto by boys. It was entirely without accompaniment. A grand Pianoforte in the room was only used to announce the pitch before each piece. [... H]ere is a chorus who stand up and sing Bach’s and other most difficult motets, the most difficult vocal music perhaps ever written, by voices alone, with as much certainty as the sure aim of an experienced marksman. I think I have never before witnessed such devotion to the work as in these singers. Here is indeed entire self-committal. Every one throws all the powers he has, physical and spiritual, into the performance of the music. Every tone is attacked with a conscious certainty of success; no matter how complicated the rhythm, it is given with an energy and truthfulness that a first-rate violinist can hardly excel. The singers seem to have a perfect command of their vocal organs, and are no less certain of results than is the accomplished pianist when he strikes the keys, or the violinist when he draws the bow. There is an entire absence of that sleepiness, drowsiness, inattention, and foolish levity too often witnessed in our choirs. No looking about, or whispering, or laughing, or silliness; but close attention is ever manifested. I wish I had words to point out that consecration to the work, that deep, heartfelt interest which these choir members seem to possess; so that it might be sought for by our American singers. [...] I have never before heard a vocal chorus so prompt, so energetic, and perfect in time and tune, as on this occasion. The place, too, was holy ground, for all the great musicians have visited that saloon; Bach lived there as his home, and Handel, and Haydn, and Mozart, and Beethoven have been there. A new portrait of Bach (or rather an old one put in perfect order) has been placed at the head of the hall, and opposite to it is a fine bust of Schicht, who, though less known, was a very profound musician, as his works testify.

Although Sophie Cruvelli, at this stage of her career, may not have been a faultless vocalist — (and it has been already seen how Rubini had declared, ""Give her good models to study, and a good master, and she mil be great"") — she came, nevertheless, before the London audience with so many natural advantages that she was at once acknowledged as certain to become a general favourite. Indeed, it may be fairly assumed that, had not Jenny Lind so completely absorbed the public mind and thus rendered any rivalry in public estimation almost impossible, Sophie Cruvelli would have exercised even greater sway over the operatic world of London. She was endowed with rare and precious gifts — a magnificent organ, sufficient artistic capacity, and a highly attractive person. She possessed, too, a certain quality which might become a treasure or a bane, according to the way in which she applied it. This was an impulsive, ardent, almost reckless genius — a quality capable of achieving great results, but requiring to be reined in by judgment, taste, and tact, so as not to overspring the boundaries of legitimate art, or (in common parlance) to ""run wild."" Had she the tact, the taste, the judgment? Upon these depended her future greatness. There is no doubt, however, that in spite of the sudden and awful nervousness which fell upon her when for the first time she faced the densely-crowded audience of Her Majesty's Theatre, the aspect of which somewhat paralysed her efforts in her aria entrata, Sophie Cruvelli did achieve a signal success on the occasion of her debut.

Steady and sound as a musician, Beletti seemed to place his feet upon the boards of the opera-house with a consciousness that it was firm ground. He had a sonorous and flexible voice, sang in a careful, correct style, with a voluble delivery, but was endowed with little power as an actor. Beletti took up his position from the very first evening of his appearance — a position incontestable and uncontested. This was a pleasing circumstance for her who had in some measure staked her own reputation for judgment on the success of her estimable comrade.  Cuzzani, the favourite of the Berliners, was less happy in his debut. He was pronounced to be “pleasant,"" ""nice,"" or any other epithet that did not go beyond a certain succes d'estime. He appeared under the disadvantage of an influenza; but the judgment of the public was never wholly reversed, either on subsequent evenings or in other operas.  So great had been the popularity of Gardoni during the previous season, that to produce their pet sympathetic tenor before the habitues of Her Majesty's Theatre, was ever to ""play a trump card."" On this account the young singer was ""cast"" for the character of the king in ""Ernani”; the part in the original score being written for a baritone. Some of the music was consequently transposed for Gardoni. But the commanding power of voice required to enable him to predominate in the great finale of the third act, was wanting ; and accordingly the reputation of the favourite tenor nowise gained by this venture. Still, by dint of all the varied interest due to the novelty of the ""cast,"" ""Ernani"" worked its way, and gave a very important prestige to the opening of Her Majesty's Theatre for the season of 1848.",False,The passage does not provide any information or evidence related to children's experience of music.

Here was again a success- nay, a great and noisy success — but yet a doubtful one. After the comparative unanimity with which ""Nabucco"" had been received, it seemed necessary for the forces of the opposition to recommence the attack against a school which now threatened to make its way with the town. Party spirit on the subject was again rife. Whilst, by the Anti-Verdians, ""I Lombardi"" was declared to be flimsy, trashy, worthless ; the Verdi party, and the adherents of the modern Italian school, pronounced it to be full of power, vigour, and originality. The one portion asserted that it was utterly devoid of melody — the other, that it was replete with melody of the most charming kind; the one again insisted that it was the worst work of the aspirant — the other, that it was the young composer's chef-d'oeuvre. And in the midst of this conflict — so analogous to the old feud between the partizans of Gluck and Piccini — public opinion, as usual, seemed undecided and wavering, uttering its old formula of ""Well! I don't know!""

This unusual proceeding was afterwards explained to me as being his usual plan for testing a man, for finding that his time had been too often wasted upon men whose acquaintance with music and organs was very limited, and who generally mistook enthusiasm for knowledge, the Professor was compelled to adopt some scheme, whereby he might be enabled to judge of his visitors’ musical capabilities.

The selection comprised Bach’s grand Prelude and Fugue in B minor ; Louis Thiele’s air and elaborate variations in A flat; some variations of his own on a chorale ; and a short improvisation. The salient features of his playing were more especially exhibited in the Fugue of Bach’s, played as it was with remarkable dignity and grandeur of style—at a speed too, considerably slower than that usually adopted by the majority of modern English organists.

Presently, he sank back into his seat, covering his face with his hands; and when we next caught a glimpse of his sad grey eyes, they were wet with happy tears. Never before or since that memorable night have I heard the quartet — perhaps his most passionate and romantic composition for strings — so magnificently played, or so enthusiastically applauded.

http://data.open.ac.uk/led/lexp/1450350186677,"The first concert we ever gave in Topeka, Kansas, about thirty-five years ago, was signalized by a scene I shall not soon forget. We had a full house in the local concert hall. I noticed when we began to play that the front row of seats was empty, evidently reserved for some special people. Those “specials” came in while we played our first piece. They were Indians, about twelve in number, some being “blanket Indians”—which means that they wore their brilliant blue and yellow striped blankets shawl-wise, and their buckskin moccasins, and that their faces and front hair were painted. The rest of the party were dressed like good, stock-raising American farmers, but were unmistakably Indians. I was told there was a father with six sons in the party, all very large, broad-shouldered men. They filed quietly into their seats, preceded by a local guide, in whose hands they seemed like good, docile children. […]   No shadow of emotion could be seen on their countenances. The fifth number of the programme was a violin solo played by Mr. Schultze, and for an encore he gave a little caprice entitled, The Bird in the Tree, a charming jeu d'esprit, by Miska Hauser, which represents the joyful, almost delirious, singing of a wild bird in the woods. The moment Mr. Schultze began this piece, the Indians were all alive, their eyes sparkled with pleasure, and they nudged each other with their elbows. And when the little bird-melody and imitations of bird singing began (all done in high harmonic, flageolet tones on the violin), they looked all around the ceiling and the walls, doubtless expecting to see singing-birds flitting about. Not seeing any, they looked at the violinist, and began to understand that he was the magician. The surprise, and almost incredulity, which was depicted on the faces of these children of nature was a rare show in itself. At its conclusion they jumped up and down just as little children do when something unusual pleases them. This violin piece ended the first part of the programme. Our second part began with another serious piece, and the twelve pairs of eyes lapsed into the ox-like placidity again. Very shortly the red men had had enough of us “ freaks,” and they quietly rose and filed out of the hall.",True,"The passage describes the reaction of a group of Native American Indians, referred to as 'children of nature', to a violin solo. They exhibit signs of joy, surprise, and excitement similar to how young children would react when something pleases them. This suggests that the passage provides evidence of children's experience with music and their emotional responses to it."

It was Louis GEYER, his step-father; painter, author, and actor, then on his death-bed, thinking of the future, planning as dying men plan, and hitting the mark as they often hit it, quite at random. The child's vivid temperament and eager, sensitive mind had always made him a favourite with the actor and the poet, and he thought of making a painter of RICHARD, but the boy seemed to have no turn for it. His mother, a woman full of life and imagination, was less anxious and more wise.

The fame  of Leoncavallo's sensational opera had preceded  it, and the public expected something remarkable.  They were not disappointed. I have rarely seen an audience so breathless with excitement over the development of an opera plot. The effect of  the little tragedy was augmented by the burning intensity of De Lucia, whose portrayal of the hapless Canio's anguish and suffering was a triumph of realism. His touching soliloquy at the end of  the first act was delivered with an abandonment  of feeling that completely carried away his auditors. Very fine, too, was Ancona's rendering of the  already famous Prologue; deliciously pure and  sweet was Melba's vocalization in the haUateUa for Nedda; excellent were the new-comers Richard Green and Bonnard as Silvio and Peppe;  while Mancinelli's conducting left not a point  undiscerned throughout. Leoncavallo, modest and unassuming, waited quietly in the background  till the end, and then had to be forced on to the stage by the artists to acknowledge the ovation  that awaited him. This was quite early in the season (May 19), and Leoncavallo remained in  London for several weeks. I found him to be a man of great culture and strong intellect.

After dinner, the weather being warm the party strolled in the garden attached to the Embassy — Catalani and Jenny Lind talking much together. In the evening, some little embarrassment arose about asking Jenny Lind to sing, because, as no one ever refuses a request made by the representative of majesty, the Marchioness considerately forbore to place the young Swede in a position of difficulty. But Catalani, who was burning vsdth curiosity to hear Jenny Lind sing, perceived that there was some hesitation, went up to the ""Nightingale,"" and asked her with grace and earnestness to oblige the company with a song, adding, ""C'est la vieille Catalani qui desire vous entendre chanter, avant de mourir !""  Such an appeal from such a person, overcame all Jenny's habitual dislike to sing in private society.

Now, the salon at the Embassy was exceedingly ill-adapted for vocal display, being crowded with stuffed sofas, chairs, and other heavy furniture, curtains inclusive. Jenny Lind's beautiful voice was consequently heard under sensible disadvantage; moreover, she had to sing in a sitting posture instead of standing up. Nevertheless, the many obvious merits of her style, taste, and execution enchanted the Italian ear of Catalani, who sat on the ottoman in the centre of the room, enjoying the rare treat, rocking her body to and fro with delight and sympathy, and murmuring (loud enough to be overheard by Mrs. G, who sat by her side), ""Ah! la bella cosa che la musica, quando si fa di quella maniera !"" — and again, ""Ah ! la carissima ! quanto bellissima !""

Public performances by some one of them are very frequent; so frequent indeed, that we can find time for only now and then one. The first for the season was by the ""Sacred Harmonic Society,"" under Mr. Costa, and consisted of a selection from ""Samson,"" by Handel, Mendelssohn's ""Christus,"" ""The Last Judgment,"" by Spohr. The death of the illustrious Duke gave a tinge to all the earlier concerts, and the ""Dead March"" in Saul was in constant requisition. On the present occasion, the selection from ""Samson"" consisted of the air, ""Ye Sons of Israel,"" ""Dead March,"" and chorus,  ""Glorious hero, may thy grave Peace and honor ever have.""  The ""Christus"" by Mendelssohn, seems to be very popular, both among the singers and hearers. The chorale, ""As bright the Star of Morning gleams,"" one of the best German chorales, and one that is very often heard in their churches, is brought in with fine effect after the chorus, ""There shall a Star of Jacob come forth."" Mendelssohn is always great in such choruses as ""He stirreth up the Jews,"" ""Crucify Him,"" and others in which he depends mostly upon orchestral effect, and in which he carries out his ideas of imitation or description with all the powers of modem instrumentation.  Spohr's oratorio was well given, the Gresham Professor himself being judge; for we had the honor of a seat by his side, and of listening to his remarks during the perormance. Mr. Taylor was the first to bring out Spohr in England. ""Die letzten Dinge,"" or ""The Last Things,"" (which is a much better title for the oratorio than the one it now bears,) was composed about twenty-five years ago.

Prof. Taylor says: ""It at once seized the public attention, and commanded the admiration of the most distinguished professors of every school. Its influences upon the feelings of an audience has been attested by expressions more decided and unequivocal than I ever remember to have witnessed. I speak not of the admiration which the musician derives from such a display of the power and the resources of his art, but of the homage which nature, though musically untutored, involuntarily yet willingly pays to genius. The throbbing heart, the moistening eye, the quivering lip, here bespeak the triumph of the composer."" The solo parts were sustained by Mrs. Endersohn, Miss Williams, Mr. Lockey and Mr. Phillips.

This event  created interest at the time among a very limited  circle. It was anticipated with curiosity only by  the critics and dilettanti who follow the trend of  musical events in Paris. For several months we  had been receiving vivid accounts of a young Polish pianist, “with a wonderful aureole of golden hair,” who executed miracles upon the keyboard,  who composed delicious minuets and played Chopin to absolute perfection. But London cares  little, as a rule, for what Paris thinks of new artists, and it displayed anything but a burning impatience to hear Leschetizky 's latest pupil. This  fact was sufficiently demonstrated by the meagre  audience which gathered at St. James 's Hall on the  9th of May for the first of the four recitals announced by the composer of “Paderewski 's Minuet”.  A more coldly critical assemblage perhaps  it would have been impossible to find. Not a  soupcon of magnetic current was in the atmosphere—not even the quickened pulse arising from  the anticipation of “sensational effects.""   When M. Paderewski appeared upon the platform there was a mild round of applause accompanied by an undercurrent of whispering and suppressed murmurs that had evident reference to his  unwonted picturesqueness of aspect. The deep  golden tinge of his hair seemed to accentuate the  intense pallor of his countenance. One could  plainly see that he was nervous; but in those deep,  thoughtful eyes, in those firmly-set lips, in that  determined chin, one could read also the strong,  virile qualities of the self-contained, self-reliant  artist, already accustomed to conquer audiences  and to create magnetism in the most sterile space.  Exactly how he played that day— I mean, as compared with the Paderewski whose every mood was  by and by to become familiar— it is rather hard  for me to say. That he strove to be “sensational”  I do not believe now, though at the time it was  difficult to think otherwise. For surely his contrasts were startling in their violence, and the instrument fairly thundered under his execution of  a forte passage. At times there seemed to be no  restraint whatever. His magnificent technique  enabled him to give free rein to his impulse and  imagination, and laissez aller was then the word.  If you loved sensationalism in a pianist, here unquestionably was a virtuoso capable of providing  an unlimited quantity of it.

She came in a light blue muslin dress; sat down hurriedly, and tossed her curls back, looking straight up at the ceiling, whilst her fingers ran quickly in a slight prelude over the keys; then she plunged into a polonaise or something of the kind; it might have been one of poor CHOPIN'S; it probably was, for he was about that time the rage, and quite in the last stage, dying of consumption in London and Scotch drawing-rooms, catching fresh colds every night, faultlessly attired in the miserable dress clothes and exposed shirt-front of the period.

There should always, I think, be an introductory voluntary, whether there is a processional hymn or not. It has, if properly selected, or ably improvised, a calming influence on the mind, which prepares, with dulcet music, the humble worshipper for his subsequent duties. The sounds of the organ die away, the distant “Amen” after the choristers’ prayer is heard, and the procession of the priests and white-robed choir from the vestry to their stalls in the chancel, is accompanied with a more joyous strain from the organ, which gradually subsides, and the respected vicar, the Rev. G. Hume Smith, then commences to intone the sentences, preces, etc., in a manner which shows at once that you are listening to one who,“with practice severe and tone loud and clear,” has attained to the highest point of chanting power, not to be wondered at when the Vicar’s long connection as Precentor with the Leeds Parish Church is remembered. The Versicles and responses by Tallis were nicely sung by the choir, with the exception of the usual drop in the pitch. The grand old chant in C, of whose authorship we know nothing more than that it is called “ Ancient,” was a right one for Venite, Exultemus, and with hearty and expressive alternate unison and harmony did the choir unto Sing unto the Lord.” The Psalms (6th day), commencing with the 30th, Exaltabo te, Dotnine (“I will magnify Thee, O Lord”) were sung to the old familiar appropriate double chant in E flat, by Robinson (John, who was organist at Westminster Abbey in 1762), and another by an unknown author. The Psalms throughout, from Monk and Ouseley’s Psalter, were chanted admirably—clearness and distinctness of enunciation, good intonation, and an exactitude of time and ensemble worthy of a cathedral choir. The same may be said of the Te Deum, also given to a double chant, without any change or variety, and this I think might be rectified either by the introduction of specially composed Te Deum chants, or the more easy settings—anthem-wise. A fine, solemn effect was obtained by the singing of the verse “Holy, Holy, Holy!” without organ accompaniment, and in which the sweet female voices of the choir added greatly to the result. The Apostle’s Creed, monotoned with varied organ accompaniment on A, made the pitch rather too high for the subsequent sentences and responses. The anthem by Stainer, “Jesus said unto his disciples"" sung very nicely, though it presented no particular features of power or interest, was preceded by a much too long introduction on the organ, not reminding one of any particular theme or subject, though serving as a medium for showing the good and varied qualities in the organ.

Of these gorgeous, and at the same time tasteful embellishments, a general approval prevailed; whilst the aspect of the vast and elegant interior, in its fresh and magnificent array, struck every eye. Curiosity had been more legitimately, although perhaps less eagerly, excited by the striking novelties which the first night of the season was to produce. The ""Nabucco"" of Verdi, a work which was popular on the Continent, and had in some places caused a perfect furore, was selected to inaugurate the new salle. That Verdi had already made way against his wholesale detractors, was rendered evident by the generally better feeling with which the music of ""Nabucco"" was accepted. In a popular sense, the opera was a decided success; the choral melodies especially suiting the public taste. The libretto, although faulty in many respects, was dramatic, and afforded scope for fine acting and artistic emotion. ""Nabucco,"" in short, floated on the sea of the Anglo-Italian stage, where, whilst one current was always rushing towards novelty, another tended to wreck all novelty whatever in the interests of so-called ""classicism."" Much had been done to place the opera with splendour on the stage, but though it pleased as a whole, no decided success attended the venture of the two new ladies. Sanchioli, wild, vehement, and somewhat coarse, attracted and excited by her ""power, spirit, and fire,"" but she failed to charm. As a ""declaiming, passionate vocalist,"" she created an effect; but the very qualities which had rendered her so popular with an Italian audience, acted somewhat repulsively upon English opera-goers. The lack of refinement in her style was not in their eyes redeemed by the merit of energy. The electric impulse that communicated itself to the Italians, fell comparatively powerless on the British temperament. Sanchioli, however, was in many respects the ""right woman in the right place,"" in this melodramatic opera. The other lady, Mademoiselle Corbari, though destined in after times to please greatly as an altra-prima on the Anglo-Italian stage, and though she was considered from the first, charming, even ""fascinating"" in her simplicity and grace, was not yet acknowledged as a leading vocalist. The nervousness and inexperience of a novice, which she showed at this stage of her career, somewhat lessened the success due to a sweet voice and feeling style, though the prayer allotted to her character, Fenena, was encored nightly. Fornasari pleased those who remained of his old enthusiastic admirers, by his emphatic dramatic action and vigorous declamation, and thus far worked towards the success of Verdi's new opera. It is not unworthy of record that, in compliance with that repugnance which is prevalent in the English mind against any dramatic subject referring however remotely to biblical history, and which had already transformed ""Mose"" into ""Pietro L'Eremita,"" the ""Nabucco"" of the Italian stage was condemned to assume on this occasion an alias under the title of ""Nino Ee D'Assyria.""

One was the first production in London of Wagner's “Lohengrin”; the other, the first appearance there of the Carl Rosa Opera Company. The former was regarded almost in the light of an experiment. Never before had an opera by Wagner been performed at Covent Garden. In 1870 his “Fliegende Hollander” had been given at Drury Lane, under the Italian title of “L’Ollandese Dannato"" (Luigi Arditi conducting), but without any very marked success. And now here was “Lohengrin”, a more advanced example of the composer's method, about to claim the suffrages of a public still notoriously unprepared for the comprehension or enjoyment of what was generally described as the “music of the future”. Yet, thanks to the growing numbers of the German community, the event aroused intense excitement, and the opera-house was packed to overflowing. I think it was the worst performance of “Lohengrin” ever seen in an important theatre. Albani (then in her third season) made a sympathetic Elsa; Nicolini presented a heroic-looking Lohengrin and sang wonderfully well, considering how completely out of his element he was in Wagnerian opera; and Cotogni did creditably as Telramund. But the remainder of the cast were beneath notice, while the chorus sang dreadfully out of tune, and the orchestra, under Vianesi, did its best to drown the singers throughout. Yet, in spite of these drawbacks, the beauty of the music exercised its inevitably powerful sway, and the opera was received with a warmth that grew and grew till it culminated in a tremendous climax of enthusiasm. The “tooth-and-nail” opponents of Wagner, who flourished exceedingly in London at this time, were simply dumfounded. In all probability, “Lohengrin” was as new to them as it was to Covent Garden habitues, and they did not know whether to be more astonished at the subtle fascination of the music or at the ease with which its charm and significance had been grasped by an “unripe” public.

A fugue is introduced, and the closing movement, to the word Amen, is very animating and triumphant.

Nordica’s sister (Mrs. Walker) and Mr. Amherst Webber, the talented English maestro at piano who had recently acted as accompanist to the brothers in their Wagnerian studies. After supper the conversation turned upon Bayreuth, and allusion was made to a certain half-promise given by Jean de Reszke to Frau Cosima, that he would one day sing Tristan and Walther, or perhaps even Siegfried, at the festival. I remarked that, after what I had heard that night, I entertained no doubts concerning the adequate quality of his accent. This only elicited a further request that I would stay in New York until I had heard how it sounded in “Tristan”. Then the distinguished tenor turned to Mme.

The musicians went with him from room to room, and Bach was invited everywhere to try and to play unpremeditated compositions. After he had gone on for some time, he asked the King to give him a subject for a fugue, in order to execute it immediately without any pre­paration. The King admired the learned manner in which his subject was thus executed extempore ; and, probably to see how far such an art can be carried, expressed a wish to hear a fugue with six obbligato parts. But as it is not every subject that is fit for such full harmony, Bach chose one himself, and immediately executed it, to the astonishment of all present, in the same magnificent and learned manner as he had done that of the King.

Now, with almost startling suddenness, the metropolis found itself the scene of two weighty enterprises which were destined to give an even stronger fillip to the spread of the Bayreuth master's art than his own visit in 1877. To be candid, the double dose, taken well-nigh simultaneously, proved rather too heavy for the receptive capacity of the general public. But the German community again rallied in brave numbers to this musical call from the Fatherland, and, alike with money and plaudits, proffered substantial support to the cause. Early in the year a troupe had been formed by Herr Angelo Neumann for the purpose of performing “Der Ring des Nibelungen"" in the leading cities of Germany, Austria, Holland, England, and Italy. The months of May and June were chosen for the London visit, and Her Majesty's Theatre was engaged. In all, four cycles of the tetralogy were given. Of these I attended two, and then for the first time felt that I was beginning to obtain an insight into the real scope and meaning of this gigantic work. The casts included not a few of the famous artists who had taken part in the initial representation of the “Ring” at Bayreuth in 1876,— among them Niemann, linger, the Vogls, Hill, Schlosser, and Lilli Lehmann (who sang Woglinde, Helmivige, and the ""Bird"" music); with that admirable artist, Reicher-Kindermann, as Brilnnhilde. The conductor was the lamented Anton Seidl, who then made his first appearance in London. He at once won the high approval of connoisseurs by the skill which he displayed— with by no means first-rate material— in bringing out with clearness, refinement, and intellectuality the beauties of Wagner's colossal score. It was through no fault of Seidl's that the representations were at many points open to criticism; nor, we may be equally sure, was he responsible for the number of extensive ""cuts"" which disfigured the last two of the four music-dramas.",False,"The passage does not address or answer the scenario described.

I ventured to say, ""CHOPIN always maintained that you were the most perfect exponent of his works. I cannot say how grateful I should be to hear, were it only a fugitive passage of CHOPIN'S, touched by your hand.""  ""With all the pleasure in the world“ replied the immortal pianist; and again I sat down by the grand piano, and humming to him a phrase of op. 37, I begged that it might be that.  ""I will play that, and another after it."" (The second was op. 48.)  It is useless for me to attempt a description of a performance every phrase of which will be implanted in my memory, and on my heart, as long as I live.  Again, in that room, with its long bright window opening out into the summer-land, we sat in deep shadow in perfect seclusion ; not a sound but the magic notes falling at first like a soft shower of pearls or liquid drops from a fountain blown spray falling hither and thither, and changing into rainbow tints in its passage, as the harmonic progression kept changing and tossing the fugitive fragments of melody with which that exquisite nocturne opens, until it settles into the calm, happy dream, which seems to rock the listener to sleep with the deep and perfect benison of ineffable rest; then out of the dream, through a few bars, like the uneasy consciousness of a slowly awakening sleeper, and again the interlude, the blown rain of double pearls until once more the heavenly dream is resumed. I drew my chair gently nearer, I almost held my breath, not to miss a note. There was a strange concentrated anticipation about LISZT'S playing unlike anything I had ever heard not for a moment could the ear cease listening; each note seemed prophetic of the next, each yielded in importance to the next : one felt that in the soul of the player the whole nocturne existed from the beginning as one and indivisible, like a poem in the heart of a poet. The playing of the bars had to be gone through seriatim; but there were glimpses of a higher state of intuition, in which one could read thoughts without words, and possess the soul of music, without the intervention of bars and keys and strings; all the mere elements seemed to fade, nothing but perception remained. Sense of time vanished; all was as it were realised in a moment, that moment the Present the eternal Present no Past, no Future. Yet I could not help noticing each incident: the perfect, effortless independence of the fingers, mere obedient ministers of the master's thought; the complete trance of the player living in the ideal world, and reducing the world of matter about him to the flimsiest of unreal shadows; and I had time to notice the unconscious habits of the master, which have already passed into historic manner- isms in his disciples, like CARDINAL NEWMAN'S stooping gait, GARIBALDI'S half closing of the eyes, or VICTOR EMMANUEL'S toss of the head. So I noticed the first finger and thumb drawn together to emphasize a note, or the fingers doubled up, then lifted in a peculiar manner, with a gentle sweep in the middle of a phrase things in which those are determined to be like the master who can be like him in nothing else ; also the peculiar repercussion resonance, since reduced to something like a science by RUBINSTEIN, and the caressing touch, which seemed to draw the soul of the piano out of it almost before the finger reached the key-board. When LISZT passed silently to op. 48, he arrived at some stiff bravura passages, which called forth his old vigour. Yet here all was perfect; not a note slurred over or missed; the old thunder woke beneath his outstretched hands; the spirits of the vasty deep were as obedient as ever to their master's call.

One of the refugees of 1870, he had made a stay there of considerable duration, and among other pieces brought out his cantata “Gallia”, which he conducted at the opening of the Royal Albert Hall in 1871. Even previous to this, however, he had sketched his design for the work which he labeled “Opus vitae meae,"" and there is ample evidence that he spent, from first to last, upward of a dozen years upon the score of “The Redemption."" Having arranged with Messrs. Novello &amp; Co. for its publication (at the highest price ever paid at that time for an oratorio), Gounod arrived late in September to superintend the final rehearsals for its production at the Birmingham Festival. This was the last of the Midland gatherings over which Sir Michael Costa presided, and I owed to him the honor of a personal introduction to the composer of “Faust” who was then sixty-four years of age.     Gounod was one of the most fascinating men I have ever spoken with. His manner had a charm that was irresistible, and his kindly eyes, soft and melting as a woman's, would light up with a smile, now tender, now humorous, that fixed itself ineffaceably upon the memory. He could speak English fairly well, but preferred his own language, in which he was a brilliant conversationalist; and he could use to advantage a fund of keen, ready wit. He was influenced at that time by a recrudescence of that religious mysticism which had so strongly characterized his youthful career; but his tone, though earnest and thoughtful when he was dwelling upon his art, could brighten up with the lightness and gaiety of a true Parisian. He was rather upset, on the morning of the London band rehearsal at St. George's Hall, by the numerous mistakes in the parts, which led to frequent stoppages. The trouble reached a climax in the “March to Calvary,"" where, after about the ninth or tenth stop, Gounod turned to Costa and remarked: “Seulement ici puis-je pardonner tous ces arrets, quoiqu'ils gatent ma musique.”  “Pourquoi cela?"" inquired Sir Michael.  “Parceque,"" replied Gounod, ”a ce point il y a douze stations, et a chaque station il faut naturellement un arret”. After all the typographical and other errors had been rectified, the march was tried through again and went so magnificently as to arouse the master's undisguised admiration, which deepened with astonishment when Costa informed him that the instrumentalists had never seen a note of the music until that morning. Gounod said to me later, “They are wonderful readers, these English players. There is scarcely a mistake that is due to inaccurate deciphering of the notes.

It was so likewise with other parts of the service, as the Lord's Prayer and the Creed. Four metrical hymns were sung, mostly to wretched tunes, and in a wretched manner. A small choir of boys surrounded the Precentor, but there was no organ. Next to me sat a young man who seemed to try and do his best, and the poor fellow would have done pretty well had the tunes been adapted to the circumstances; but when they went up as high as F or G, alas for him! He made the attempt indeed, which is better than not to try at all, but he fell; the leap was beyond his power. He tried to take the high parts of the tune an octave lower than the proper pitch, but in these attempts he often turned somersets, though he did not always come down upon his feet. It was really pitiable to stand by him and witness his efforts; but yet the easier parts of the tune he would get right. From this example, we obtained sufficient proof of what Congregational tunes ought to be: simple and easy, so that they may be within the reach of all. St. Ann, Phuvah, Tallis, are good examples, (Cantica Laudis, p. 307.) Yet they need not all be of this rhythmic character; Olmutz, Hamburg, Marlow, are always good. Had one of these tunes been sung at the Wesleyan Chapel, the young man would have been saved from many falls and bruises.",False,"This passage does not address or answer the scenario described.

The orchestra consisted of about sixty performers, directed by that able musician and composer Dr. Julius Reitz, Mendelssohn’s friend. Whether from the intense heat and the want of proper ventilation in the building, or from the want of repose, variety and relief in the music, I was quite overcome at the end of the first act, and was compelled to return to my hotel—perhaps a wiser, if not a sadder man.

But it was not one of the best specimens of the early period of the present century, and it had owed its reputation to the correctness of its cold classicality, and, on the Anglo-Italian stage, to the powerful acting of Pasta. To modern ears it seemed tedious and almost commonplace — at all events, deficient in the dramatic warmth of later composers. The ""mantle"" of Pasta however, even to the literal acceptation of the word, had descended to her pupil; Parodi's performance created a lively interest, stamped, as it was, with the traditions of the great vocal Siddons of the Italian stage.

For this reason I quote some lines that I  penned anent M. de Reszke's impersonation at the  time:    He showed us that it was as easy for one great artist  to revive the importance and enhance the interest of a  good role as for twenty mediocrities to drag it down to  the level of their own talent. It goes without saying  that the Polish tenor copied nobody's Don Jose in particular. He knew the traditions of the character, just  as he learned those of Sir Walter von Stolzing by visiting Bayreuth. He read his Merimee and carefully studied  his libretto; but like an artist of individuality and resource, he also thought the part out for himself. The  result, curiously enough, was a conception more closely  resembling Campanini's than any we have seen since.  It was free from the melodramatic exaggeration into  which other tenors had fallen. Take, as an instance, the  last act. M. de Reszke did not make himself up like a  starved ghost, neither did he rush about like a savage   animal in a cage. He looked the picture of despair, and  he made his piteous appeal to Carmen with the tone of  a man who is yearning for love, not for an excuse to  commit murder. When at last driven to extremities, he did not gloat over his revenge nor chase his victim from  corner to corner as a cat might chase a mouse. He simply stood at the entrance to the bull-ring, and when  Carmen made her attempt to escape, he seized his dagger as by a sudden impulse and stabbed her as she was  endeavoring to pass him. An instant later he was leaning over her lifeless body in tears, horror-stricken at the deed he had committed. This surely was the true reading of the episode. Nor was it the only scene upon which  M. Jean de Reszke, with rare artistic insight, contrived  to throw a new and consistent light. He depicted with  wonderful subtlety and skill the gradual stages by which  Don Jose is drawn under Carmen's fascinating influence. Fierce and absorbing passion revealed itself in  his facial expression, his gestures, and, above all, the  thrilling tones of his voice. Never before has the beautiful passage where Jose brings forth the flower that Carmen gave him and tells her how it cheered his lonely  prison hours, been invested with such charm of voice and  such tenderness and warmth of delivery.",False,"The passage does not address or answer the scenario of characterizing children's experience of music in bibliographic and artistic sources.

His manifest vocal advantages caused him to be placed in a position to acquire a sound musical education, and thus to become one of the most agreeable tenors of his time. Nothing was expected, yet great results were achieved. With a charmingly sweet, bnt still robust voice of wonderful extension; with a style wherein the use of the falsetto was at once sparingly and judiciously employed, this young artist won easily upon a public accustomed to give a preference to natural gifts over the display of skill.

http://data.open.ac.uk/led/lexp/1438428449081,"I went to Paris expressly to attend this most interesting premiere, which took place on November 28, 1888. Seats were not only at a high premium but virtually unobtainable, and I owed the possession of mine to the courtesy of Jean de  Reszke. Many a time I have looked upon the  heavily gilded and slightly sombre interior of the  Paris Opera-house, but never when it contained such an audience, such a gathering of famous men, of elegant, jewel-bedecked women, as appeared  there on that memorable night. The grandes  dames of the French aristocracy were present, displaying a sartorial splendor that recalled the  halcyon days of the Second Empire, and what that implied I can only leave my fair readers to guess.  On taking the conductor's seat, Gounod was overwhelmed with acclamations. His calm, serene  countenance wore an encouraging smile, and no one would have dreamed that the veteran composer was as anxious as though it were the first  performance of a brand-new opera. At the outset, indeed, every one was nervous.  Many years had elapsed since Mme. Patti had appeared at the Opera, and, often as she had enacted  Juliette - this was the first time she had sung the  part in French; in the waltz air — long one of her favorite concert-pieces — she did what was for her the rarest imaginable thing: she made a slip  that carried her four bars ahead of the accompaniment (“Elle sautait quatre mesures!” as  Gounod subsequently put it). Yet, thanks to her extraordinary presence of mind, the great prima donna regained her place so quickly that probably  not twenty persons in the audience noticed the  error. Moreover, she sang the whole waltz with such grace and entrain that an encore was inevitable, and on the repetition her rendering of it was  the most brilliant I have ever heard her give. The  youthfulness and charm of her assumption were  astounding, while her fine acting in the more tragic  scenes indicated a startling advance in histrionic  force over her effort in the same opera ten years  earlier.   The new Romeo proved worthy of his association with this perfect Juliette. The mere fact that it was Jean de Reszke may be deemed sufficient guarantee of that to-day; it is not easy, however, to convey an idea of the striking revelation which his impersonation offered as, step by step, scene by scene, it unfolded itself for the first time upon  the same plane with Patti's exquisite conception.  Every attribute that distinguished the one arose, strong and clear-cut, in the other. Never before,  at least in their operatic mold, had the hapless  Veronese lovers been so faultlessly matched. Where was “monotony”, where was “tedium”, now?

http://data.open.ac.uk/led/lexp/1438778151735,"I went over to Berlin in person to offer to the Countess my escort to London; and on Saturday, the 7th of July, this interesting debut took place, in Donizetti's ""Linda di Chamouni."" The Sontag once more trod those boards which had been the scene of her early triumphs. The sympathy her reappearance had created was evidenced by the enthusiastic, and it may be said, affectionate reception with which she was greeted by an overcrowded house. The cheering was universal, genuine, unusually prolonged. That she herself should be at first deeply affected, even to tears, at a greeting so heart-felt and spontaneous, was well conceivable. The revival of old memories, at those exciting and once familiar sounds, joined to the thought of the causes which had placed her in that arena, must have moved her pro- foundly. A glance at the box where sate the husband and children for whose sake this great and noble sacrifice had been made, gave her the necessary courage. Sontag subdued her emotion. In a few minutes she was once more the artist, and the artist alone.  That a halo of interest was thrown around the high-placed lady, who had descended from her pedestal, and quitted the pride and charm of her social and domestic life to resume professional duties, long since laid aside, was perfectly intelligible. But it was not as the heroine of a romance of real life that Sontag reappeared; not as the Countess, who from well-appreciated motives had reassumed the dramatic mantle. It was as the artist alone that she had come to earn the suffrages of the public — as the artist alone that she desired to be judged. It was to sound judgment, and not to mere curiosity and sympathy, however legitimately awakened, that she appealed. And in that judgment she found her reward. Her return to the stage was one long triumph.  All had felt that it must be a marvel, if, after more than twenty years, this gifted prima donna could return with her powers unimpaired. Yet the marvel was here — an unquestionable fact. Her voice was ""as fresh, pure, and beautiful as ever."" Madame Sontag brought back an artistic skill, matured and perfected by the continued study which, since her retirement, had been to her a labour of love. The beauty, which had exercised so great a fascination over an elder generation, was, strange to say, but little changed. It was remodelled rather than effaced, whilst the figure seemed almost untouched by time. The pleasing contour of the face, the beaming and expressive eye, and, above all, the winning smile which formerly had stolen away so many hearts, were all there. Men declared that with the most clear and searching of opera- glasses they could not give her more than five-and-twenty. She was, in truth, a living marvel! And, more strange than all, the Sontag who had been deemed by a former' generation somewhat deficient as an actress (although the most exquisite of soprano singers), was discovered to have warmth, animation, expression, even power, as a dramatic artist! The fascination of her histrionic talent came to be as great as that of her faultless execution. The public is said to be a ""wayward"" creature; but, on the contrary, it is extremely difficult to be moved from prepossessions once formed for good or for evil. Whatever change may supervene in an artist, the public is loath to admit a change into its own formed opinions. Sontag left the stage with the reputation of being ""no actress."" On her return, it was almost impossible to persuade this public, wedded to traditions, that she was (what really was the case) one of the most finished and exquisite histrionic artists.",False,"The passage does not address or answer the scenario provided.

He shared my intense enthusiasm   on the subject of Jean de Reszke's  “predestination'' for the great Wagner roles, and his joy over the approaching advent of the new Walther von Stolzing knew no bounds. I was often present when he came round to the Continental to do a morning's work with the great tenor.

""LaFavorita,"" although not entirely new to England, having been already performed at London both in French and English, was new to the Italian boards; and in its Italian form had all the interest of a novelty. Perhaps, thus given as it was with singers far superior to any heard in it in this country, and with a far more correct and powerful ensemble, the opera gained in popular favour rather than lost, through the familiarity of opera-goers with its melodies. Apart from the unwonted interest attached by all the friends and habitues of the long-cherished establishment, to the opening of Her Majesty's Theatre in face of the new opposition, considerable sensation was excited by the first appearance on the Anglo-Italian stage of Signor Gardoni. Much had been said of the strange adventures that had befallen the handsome and gentlemanlike young tenor during his brief musical career. His first appearance on the stage raised a battery of opera-glasses from every part of the house; a murmur of gratified expectation followed. The success of Gardoni on this occasion was undoubted. Both his principal solos, sung in the purest taste and with perfect feeling, were encored with enthusiasm. The attraction of his performance was felt by all. Voice, style, and expression were there. His talent as an actor was alone disputed; for these were already days when a singer, however great his merit as a vocalist, was expected (and justly, on the lyrical stage) to be a histrionic artist also. It became the fashion among some dilettanti to say that Gardoni was no actor. Still, even as an actor he was pleasing. His manner, his bearing, his feeling, his conception of parts were blameless. He lacked only one element — power; he was not capable of bursts of passion.",False,"The passage does not address or answer the scenario described.

Upon her, it was said, the mantle of the illustrious prima donna had descended. Pasta herself had declared that, in the person of this object of her solicitude and her future hopes, she herself was to rise again before the world. These sentiments were repeated by Madame Pasta in a letter to me, in which she recommended “la mia Teresa"" to my care. The delight of the now aged prima donna in seeing herself revived in her favourite pupil, is apparent in every phrase. She writes: ""Plena di riconoscenza;"" and, in the fulness of her heart, exclaims, ""Oh! beata I'lnghilterra! Che Dio la renda sempra piu felice!"" The zealous and eager sympathy of the instructress with the pupil was unbounded. Mademoiselle Parodi appeared in one of the most favourite and celebrated characters of la Pasta, although the choice of this role de debut was bold and even dangerous. As has been seen in the quasi failure of Jenny Lind herself, the most popular and most adored of all prime donne of the time, in the part of Norma, it was impossible even for the most petted of pets to dare to undertake the task of rivalry, even in seeming, with the one who had been so long associated in English estimation with the true ideal of the Druid Priestess. Of all Madame Grisi's parts, Norma was the one in which no effort of rivalry was to be endured. The success of Mademoiselle Parodi, however, on her first debut, was in appearance very great. Moulded as her whole style, both as singer and actress, were upon her great prototype, she gave to a new generation an idea of the ""Pasta"" of their fathers; and, with old opera-goers, revived in some degree the memories of the past.

Her acting was distinguished, as had been that of the Siddons of the operatic stage, by simple grandeur, rather than by fiery impulse.
