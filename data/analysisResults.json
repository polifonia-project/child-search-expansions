She had one of those miniature instruments I believe a real Cremona which can still occasionally be picked up at old violin shops. I remember the enthusiasm she created in some variations on airs from \"Sonnambula\" an opera in which JENNY LIND was making furor at the time in London. The poor little violinist was recalled again and again. It was past eleven, and as she came on in her little pink dress just down to her knees holding her tiny fiddle I recollect her raising it to her chin to begin again, but her little head lay so wearily on one side, and she looked so tired that her acute father came forward, perceiving that the child was quite worn out, drew her away, and in a few words asked the people to let her off, adding that she ought to have been in bed an hour ago. I went home and tried those variations. I could not play them, but her playing of them gave me a new start."

In one place an artillery waggon was wheeled against a broken shrine; in another a group of soldiers laughed and sang as they smoked their pipe, seated on a prostrate crucifix: a tattered shirt hung to dry upon the flayed back of St. Bartholomew; and a musket leaning on the shoulder of a Virgin gave her the air of a sentinel on his post. In a word, the gens-d'armerie of his Imperial Majesty of Austria were placed here in quarters."

He and Doyle were inseparable companions, and their duets together were the delight of the gay supper-giving society in which they lived.  The entertainments of this kind given by my joyous and social mother could, for gaiety at least, match with the best. Our small front and back drawing-rooms, as well as a little closet attached to the latter, were on such occasions distended to their utmost capacity ; and the supper-table in the small closet where people had least room was accordingly always the most merry. In the round of singing that followed these repasts my mother usually took a part, having a clear, soft voice, and singing such songs as \u201cHow sweet in the woodlands,\u201d which was one of her greatest favourites, in a very pleasing manner. I was also myself one of the performers on such occasions, and gave some of Dibdin\u2019s songs, which were at that time in high vogue, with no small \u00e9clat."

The season of 1842, in obedience to this custom, opened on Saturday, the 12th April, with the \"Gemma di Vergy\" of Donizetti, Madame Moltini appearing for the first time as the prima donna, and Guasco as leading tenor. The choice of the opera, given rather to meet the views of the singers than those of the manager, was by no means felicitous. \"Gemma di Vergy,\" although abounding in melody and effects, both dramatic and musical, was not esteemed one of Donizetti's finer compositions, albeit a favourite opera in many parts of Italy. Donizetti, likewise, had found, up to this time, but slight favour with the English public, or, at all events, with the English press. He occupied, then, in this country, a position similar to that which afterwards fell to the lot of his successor, Verdi; and even among a great portion of the numerous critics, amateurs as well as \"professionals,\" he was pronounced, by many arbiters of taste, \"flimsy,\" \"meretricious,\" \"noisy,\" \"unsound,\" \"plagiarist,\" and so on. \"Gemma\" was unquestionably a failure; as, indeed, it would have proved under these prejudices with even stronger claims to approbation."

Henry, who was in business with the father, had been tutored by him upon the violoncello, and was a most accomplished performer. The style of Francis was very different from that of the father ; full of passion, exquisitely neat and delicate. In the 57th quartett of Haydn, the elder Femy impressed a force and brilliancy upon the first bar that was like the rushing of a sky-rocket into the ethereal expanse ; even Yanewick, with all his boldness, would have appeared feeble in his presence. Their combined talents were most skilfully shown in Beethoven's serenade trio; the father playing the tenor, Francis the first, and Henry the bass.

At one of these concerts, some time during the middle \u201csixties,\" I heard Jenny Lind sing. The voice, I remember perfectly, was as exquisitely clear and fresh as a young girl's; its sweet tones haunted me long afterward. Of the wondrous art of the great singer I was too young to judge ; but I shall, never forget what she sang, or the rare wealth of religious sentiment with which she invested the prayer of Agathe in the favorite scena from \u201cDer Freischutz\u201d. Upon the stage, of course, the heroine of Weber's opera always kneels while uttering her touching appeal for her lover's safe return, and Jenny Lind also knelt while singing the same passage upon the platform of St. Andrew's Hall on the occasion I am alluding to."

I can find no words to express my astonished delight when I saw the little fellow, only six years old, sit down to the pianoforte, and commence an extemporaneous performance, which baffles all description. His large dark eyes lighted up, his whole soul seemed intent upon what he was about, and yet with all this there was such a genuine childish simplicity. I could not say half of what I feel. I am afraid this will be thought an exaggeration, but I never was an admirer of wonderful children. I have seen many who had extraordinary execution upon an instrument, but God has given this child an intuitive knowledge of the most hidden mysteries of sound\u2014a creative power perfectly organized that surpasses belief. Read the accounts of Mozart's infancy and you have read this child's, I sat down to the piano, and while his mother held him at a distance, I endeavoured to puzzle him by the most intricate modulations, but he not only instantly named the key I was playing in, but followed every change (even when an enharmonic transition rendered it almost inappreciable to the ear) with the rapidity of thought,\u2014he knew it, but he knew not why. In the course of playing I struck the chord of the sharp 6th\u2014the German 6th as called by some writers, and upon resolving it in the usual way he started up and cried out \"that is the sharp 6th in the key of C minor, and I can dissolve it another way.\" He ran to the piano, and without a moment's hesitation struck the chord, and proceeded to resolve it in a most abstruse but perfectly correct manner, and then went on modulating till he brought it back to the original key. He played me numbers of the airs he had written, all distinguished by the exquisite taste and plaintiveness of their character, some marches loud and lively with an evident idea of orchestral effect in their arrangement ; indeed orchestral and dramatic effect pervades every note he plays. I can never forget the impression this scene made upon me. I am not ashamed to say that it affected me to tears. May he live to be a second Mozart is my sincere wish; may he live to prove that an Englishman can excel in the most divine of Sciences as he can in all the rest."

After complying with his request and playing for a short time, the rightful owner of the organist\u2019s seat took his place, and for one hour greatly delighted me with his performance on the instrument. The selection comprised Bach\u2019s grand Prelude and Fugue in B minor ; Louis Thiele\u2019s air and elaborate variations in A flat; some variations of his own on a chorale ; and a short improvisation.

        "text": "In Christmas time, all quarters of Naples resound with Pastorali or Siciliane, a kind of simple rural music, executed by Abruzzese or Calabrian shepherds, upon a species of bag pipes, called in Abruzzo, Zampogna, and Ciaramelli in Calabria. The tunes vary according to the provinces: in the south, they have three different airs; the northern shepherds know only two, to which they add what variations the boldness of their own genius inspires. The boys learn of their fathers to play upon this instrument as the means of subsistence. At other seasons, it is rare to hear any agreeable sounds in the streets of Naples, though it is the nursery of musical professors: a school, where the greatest masters have imbibed their principles, and acquired that knowledge of composition, which has enchanted the ears of all Europe. There is no such thing as a national music, unless we give that name to a monotonous drawling seguidilla, that serves the nurses as a lullaby to put their children to rest, and seems borrowed from the Spaniards, who, I believe, learnt it of the Moors. I never resided in any Italian town where there was a less musical turn in the populace: few songs, guittars, vielles, or organs, enliven the evenings, as in the northern states of Italy, unless they be sent for to entertain the parties that in summer sup on the shore of Posilipo.  They do not even dance to music, but perform the Tarantella to the beating of a kind of tambourine, which was in use among their ancestors, as appears by the pictures of Herculaneum."

        "text": "I have been present at the best performances in this country for many years ; but that at Bonn so surpassed all I had ever heard, that my senses were taken by surprise, and I was so completely captivated and thrown into a state of such agitation as to be obliged to leave the hall, without hearing the choral symphony, which immediately followed [...] The service opened with Beethoven's divine Mass in C. The grand orchestra was placed behind the high altar, at the sides of which were beautiful trees growing in boxes of native soil, towering to the roof. The spaces were so filled with the richest flowers and plants, that the performers were completely hidden from view. The Minster was crowded in every niche and corner, leaving a vast crowd of visitors without. When the music commenced, softly flowing with delicious melody, we scarcely knew from whence it came, and the hundred and fifty female voices pouring forth the lowest tones, produced a harmony deeply religious, and of unspeakable grandeur. Those parts of the mass which are only chanted, were upon this occasion performed at the western end of the church, by the usual choir, accompanied by the [...] stupendous organ there. The responses from the distant part were sublime, which, with the dresses and genuflexions of the priests, the swinging of the burning censers, formed a dramatic scene that was splendid and imposing."

        "reason": "The passage does not describe childhood experiences of listening to music. It discusses the talents and eccentricities of the musician Paganini as well as the opinions and descriptions of his performances.",
        "text": "[29 April 1818] In saying \" that the Italians have no taste for instrumental music in general,\" I do not mean to assert that they have not individual performers of consummate talent, among whom it would be injustice not to mention the celebrated Paganini*. He is a man of eccentric character, and irregular habits. Though generally resident at Turin, he has no fixed engagement; but, as occasion may require, makes a trading voyage through the principal cities of Italy, and can always procure a theatre, upon the condition of equal participation in the receipts. Many stories are told of the means by which he has acquired his astonishing style;\u2014such as his having been imprisoned ten years with no other resource\u2014 and the like. But, however this may be, his powers over the violin are most extraordinary.     * I subjoin the spirited description of a friend, whose musical science and acknowledged taste enable him to speak with much more authority than myself. \" Paganini's performance bears the stamp of the eccentricity of his character. As to mechanism, it is quite perfect; his tone and the thrilling intonation of his double stops are electric; his bow moves as if it were part of himself, and endued with life and feeling; his staccato is more strongly marked than I ever knew, and in the smoother passages there is a glassiness, if one may so say, which gives you the notion of the perfection of finish, and the highest refinement of practice. Though, in general, there is an ambition to display his own talents, by an excess of ornament, yet he can, if he will, play with simplicity and pathos, and then his power over the passions is equal to that of any orator or actor.\""
