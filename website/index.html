        "[1] Then it was that the Vienna Musical Union...": "Then it was that the Vienna Musical Union (Musik-Verein), with its mighty orchestra of two hundred and fifty first-class instrumentalists, had just attained its maximuim of effectiveness under Hans Eichter's gifted predecessor, Johann von Herbeck. Until it became my privilege to attend the Concerts of the Musik-Verein, I had never even dreamed of such an executant corporation or conceived such performances to be possible. All the leading artists \u2014 all the recognised \u201csoloists\" of Vienna served in its ranks.",
        "[2] A regiment with a complete band came to our...": "A regiment with a complete band came to our post I was on the watch for their first rehearsal; I begged father to take me to it He and I entered the room just as the band was beginning to play the overture to Fra Diavolo. The drum solo with which it begins transfixed me, but when the trumpet solo at the opening allegro began, I screamed with delight and father had to put his hand over my mouth to keep me from disturbing the musicians. It is safe to say that a certain little boy was present every time that band played.",
        "[3] Shortly after the beginning of August I went...": "Shortly after the beginning of August I went on a visit to my sister at Brighton, taking Isabella and Edmond [her children] with me. There I remained nearly six weeks. During that time I was invited six or seven times to the Pavilion (the Prince of Wales). One of the nights there was a very pleasant ball; the other nights his band played. It is a prodigious fine band, as he has taken a great deal of pains with them, being passionately fond of music. He sung two nights himself, which he does very agreeably.",
        "[4] About this time I received a decided impulse...": "About this time I received a decided impulse from hearing a little girl, aged six, play on the violin exquisitely, and, as it seemed to me, prodigiously. There were three sisters, named TURNER; the eldest was only fifteen : two played the harp, and the youngest, a pretty child of six, played the violin. She had one of those miniature instruments I believe a real Cremona which can still occasionally be picked up at old violin shops. I remember the enthusiasm she created in some variations on airs from \"Sonnambula\" an opera in which JENNY LIND was making furor at the time in London. The poor little violinist was recalled again and again. It was past eleven, and as she came on in her little pink dress just down to her knees holding her tiny fiddle I recollect her raising it to her chin to begin again, but her little head lay so wearily on one side, and she looked so tired that her acute father came forward, perceiving that the child was quite worn out, drew her away, and in a few words asked the people to let her off, adding that she ought to have been in bed an hour ago. I went home and tried those variations. I could not play them, but her playing of them gave me a new start.",
        "[5] My last recollection of Heidelberg is a...": "My last recollection of Heidelberg is a concert given by the celebrated violinist Joachim. I was taken to it as a great treat, and wore a new silk dress for the occasion. I also wore a grand little opera-cloak trimmed with swansdown. To tell the truth, I was so taken up with the unusual splendour of my appearance that I hardly listened to the music. It is an awful confession, but I am obliged to make it.",
        "[6] In consequence of the necessity of performing...": "In consequence of the necessity of performing quarantine we were not allowed time to examine the interior of Otranto; we were therefore not able to judge of its riches and its population, which is said to amount to 3000 souls. The quay was covered with merchandizes, and the number of ships which frequented the port made us conclude that commerce was in a flourishing state: the city also appeared busy and active. In the evening we perceived on the beach some equipages more rich than elegant, and some gentlemen on horseback well mounted. The pretty peasant girls wore bodices of taffeta and skirts of white muslin, and their heads were covered with straw hats or silk handkerchiefs. Until the night was far advanced the air resounded with strains of music, and with melodious voices mingling with the sound of all kinds of instruments.",
        "[7] The letters of Bunsen have often borne...": "The letters of Bunsen have often borne testimony to the benefit and the relief he experienced from a work of the highest art, such as the successful performance of a piece of Shakespeare, in clearing the mind of care, and restoring elasticity to the overstrained powers ; and he often had opportunity, during the managership of Mr. Macready, of enjoying that recreation, and adding his meed of applause to the completeness of the entire arrangements, as well as the excellence of individual representation\u2014for instance, in the case of Macready's Brutus (as in later years of Lear), in which he felt that the conceptions of Shakespeare were made more perceptible than the mere dead letter could render them. More than once did he enjoy Handel's ' Acis and Galatea,' then brought out in the full perfection of the combined fine arts, as each could be brought to bear on the performance\u2014the bright and graceful, though frivolous poetry of Gay ; the depth and breadth and versatility of Handel's musical feeling, as he endeavoured to represent the tragedy first in preparation and then in solution ; the luxury of decoration achieving the effect and earning the praise of landscape-painting; the pastoral groups elevated by the just choice of drapery into a peasantry of ancient Greece ; and last not least effective, the voices and demeanour of the performers.",
        "[8] In our visit to SANTA MARIA DELLA GRAZIE...": "In our visit to SANTA MARIA DELLA GRAZIE, we were accompanied by an eminent artist [Signore Serangeli], to whose most kind and useful attentions we stood deeply indebted; and by some other Italians well versed in the story and fortunes of the Last Supper. The fine old cloisters of the monastery join the church, and surround a spacious court. Their Gothic pillars, groined arches, and curved roof, are enriched with the fine frescoes of Bernardo Zenale, who, it is said, assisted Leonardo in the plan of the Cenacolo. But though they still exhibit tints of ultra-marine, blue and bright as the skies that shine over them, they were chipping off and falling at our feet as we passed. Here, where many a morbid enthusiast had paced in the silence of brooding meditation, or gazed on the moonlight which illumined the frescoes of Bernardo, we found only the noise and bustle of military existence. In one place an artillery waggon was wheeled against a broken shrine; in another a group of soldiers laughed and sang as they smoked their pipe, seated on a prostrate crucifix: a tattered shirt hung to dry upon the flayed back of St. Bartholomew; and a musket leaning on the shoulder of a Virgin gave her the air of a sentinel on his post. In a word, the gens-d'armerie of his Imperial Majesty of Austria were placed here in quarters.",
        "[9] Among the guests at my mothers gay parties...": "Among the guests at my mother\u2019s gay parties and suppers, were two persons, Wesley Doyle and the well known Joe Kelly (brother of Michael), whose musical talents were in their several ways of the most agreeable kind. Doyle\u2019s father being a professor of music, he had received regular instructions in the art, and having a very sweet and touching voice, was able to accompany himself on the piano-forte. Kelly, on the other hand, who knew nothing of the science of music, and at that time, indeed, could hardly write his own name, had taken, when quite a youth, to the profession of the stage, and having a beautiful voice and a handsome face and person, met with considerable success. He and Doyle were inseparable companions, and their duets together were the delight of the gay supper-giving society in which they lived.  The entertainments of this kind given by my joyous and social mother could, for gaiety at least, match with the best. Our small front and back drawing-rooms, as well as a little closet attached to the latter, were on such occasions distended to their utmost capacity ; and the supper-table in the small closet where people had least room was accordingly always the most merry. In the round of singing that followed these repasts my mother usually took a part, having a clear, soft voice, and singing such songs as \u201cHow sweet in the woodlands,\u201d which was one of her greatest favourites, in a very pleasing manner. I was also myself one of the performers on such occasions, and gave some of Dibdin\u2019s songs, which were at that time in high vogue, with no small \u00e9clat.",
        "[10] Nearer and dearer [than Lord Byron and...": "Nearer and dearer [than Lord Byron and other poets] to hearts like ours was the Ettrick Shepherd, then in his full tide of song and story; but nearer and dearer still than he, or any living songster\u2014to us dearer\u2014was our ill-fated fellow-craftsman, [Robert] Tannahill, who had just taken himself from a neglecting world, while yet that world waxed mellow in his lay. Poor weaver chiel [child]! What we owe to thee! Your \u201cBraes o\u2019 Balquidder,\u201d and \u201cYon Burnside,\u201d and \u201cGloomy Winter,\u201d and the \u201cMinstrel\u2019s\u2019\u2019 wailing ditty, and the noble \u201cGleneiffer.\u201d Oh! how they did ring above the rattling of a hundred shuttles! Let me again proclaim the debt we owe those Song Spirits, as they walked in melody from loom to loom, ministering to the low-hearted; and when the breast was filled with everything but hope and happiness, and all but seared, let only break forth the healthy and vigorous chorus [of Robert Burns] \u201cA man\u2019s a man for a\u2019 that,\u201d the fagged weaver brightens up. His very shuttle skytes boldly along, and clatters through in faithful time to the tune of his merrier shopmates!  Who dare measure in doubt the restraining influences of these very Songs? To us they were all instead of sermons [\u2026] Church bells rang not for us. Poets were indeed our Priests.",
        "[11] At this period it was the custom to give a...": "At this period it was the custom to give a preliminary opera season before Easter, during which the great \"stars,\" who were then ordinarily engaged in Paris, Seldom appeared; inferior, or, at all events, less well-known artists, being usually engaged. This was a sort of foretaste of the richer banquet to be given when the Lenten season was over, and was generally supposed to be less relished than the post-Easter entertainment. The season of 1842, in obedience to this custom, opened on Saturday, the 12th April, with the \"Gemma di Vergy\" of Donizetti, Madame Moltini appearing for the first time as the prima donna, and Guasco as leading tenor. The choice of the opera, given rather to meet the views of the singers than those of the manager, was by no means felicitous. \"Gemma di Vergy,\" although abounding in melody and effects, both dramatic and musical, was not esteemed one of Donizetti's finer compositions, albeit a favourite opera in many parts of Italy. Donizetti, likewise, had found, up to this time, but slight favour with the English public, or, at all events, with the English press. He occupied, then, in this country, a position similar to that which afterwards fell to the lot of his successor, Verdi; and even among a great portion of the numerous critics, amateurs as well as \"professionals,\" he was pronounced, by many arbiters of taste, \"flimsy,\" \"meretricious,\" \"noisy,\" \"unsound,\" \"plagiarist,\" and so on. \"Gemma\" was unquestionably a failure; as, indeed, it would have proved under these prejudices with even stronger claims to approbation.",
        "[12] Mr. Ambrose Femy, a Martinico merchant...": "Mr. Ambrose Femy, a Martinico merchant, called upon me in the way of trade. He had with him his two sons ; and our trading affair being ended, hearing that I was fond of music, he informed me they were violin-players, and proposed to have a trio of Beethoven's in the evening. It was at the Angel Inn that I met them. The father, a large stout man, had a force and breadth of play, a grandeur of style, surpassing everything I had hitherto heard upon the violin [...] His love of music led him to carry his son Francis to Paris, and to place him under Cherubini, to be educated in the musical profession. Henry, who was in business with the father, had been tutored by him upon the violoncello, and was a most accomplished performer. The style of Francis was very different from that of the father ; full of passion, exquisitely neat and delicate. In the 57th quartett of Haydn, the elder Femy impressed a force and brilliancy upon the first bar that was like the rushing of a sky-rocket into the ethereal expanse ; even Yanewick, with all his boldness, would have appeared feeble in his presence. Their combined talents were most skilfully shown in Beethoven's serenade trio; the father playing the tenor, Francis the first, and Henry the bass. Such was the unity of taste, and perfection of intonation, that the piece sparkled from beginning to end.",
        "[13] It was in St. Andrew's Hall, also, that I...": "It was in St. Andrew's Hall, also, that I was vouchsafed as a boy the privilege of hearing, on a solitary occasion only, one of the greatest artists the world has ever possessed. I refer to Jenny Lind. The close association which existed between that gifted and noble woman and the city of Norwich is a matter of common knowledge. A bishop of Norwich (Dr. Stanley) it was who persuaded the first of the \u201cSwedish Nightingales\" to abandon, on religious grounds, the operatic stage; which premature and much-regretted event occurred in 1849. But the famous singer frequently visited Norwich, and more than once she appeared at concerts given on behalf of the funds of the Jenny Lind Infirmary for Children, an institution founded by her and still flourishing in the old city. At one of these concerts, some time during the middle \u201csixties,\" I heard Jenny Lind sing. The voice, I remember perfectly, was as exquisitely clear and fresh as a young girl's; its sweet tones haunted me long afterward. Of the wondrous art of the great singer I was too young to judge ; but I shall, never forget what she sang, or the rare wealth of religious sentiment with which she invested the prayer of Agathe in the favorite scena from \u201cDer Freischutz\u201d. Upon the stage, of course, the heroine of Weber's opera always kneels while uttering her touching appeal for her lover's safe return, and Jenny Lind also knelt while singing the same passage upon the platform of St. Andrew's Hall on the occasion I am alluding to.",

They sung a Psalme before they sat down to supper in the greate hall, to an Organ which played all the time, & sung with that cherefull harmony, as seem'd to me a vision of heavenly Angels: & I came from the place with infinite Satisfaction, having never in my life seene a more noble, pious, & admirable Charity",
        "[2] The next adventure that befel me in my visit to the Short-Timers...": "The next adventure that befel me in my visit to the Short-Timers, was the sudden apparition of a military band…. I saw with astonishment that several musical instruments, brazen and of great size, appeared to have suddenly developed two legs each, and to be trotting about a yard. And my astonishment was heightened when I observed a large drum, that had previously been leaning helpless against a wall, taking up a stout position on four legs. Approaching this drum and looking over it, I found two boys behind it (it was too much for one), and then I found that each of the brazen instruments had brought out a boy, and was going to discourse sweet sounds. The boys — not omitting the fifer, now playing a new instrument - were dressed in neat uniform, and stood up in a circle at their music-stands, like any other Military Band. They played a march or two, and then we had Cheer boys, Cheer, and then we had Yankee Doodle, and we finished, as in loyal duty bound, with God Save the Queen. The band’s proficiency was perfectly wonderful, and it was not at all wonderful that the whole body corporate of Short-Timers listened with faces of the liveliest interest and pleasure…. [I]n a great class-room I found myself now, with the whole choral force of Short- Timers singing the praises of a summer’s day to the harmonium, and my small but highly-respected friend the fifer blazing away vocally, as if he had been saving up his wind for the last twelvemonth; also the whole crew of the good ship Nameless swarming up and down the scale as if they had never swarmed up and down the rigging. This done, we threw our whole power into God bless the Prince of Wales, and blessed his Royal Highness to such an extent that, for my own uncommercial part, I gasped again when it was over.",
        "[3] When, in 1847, it was demonstrated to them [the Governors of...": "[W]hen, in 1847, it was demonstrated to them [the Governors of the Foundling Hospital]... that the establishment of a Juvenile Band of musicians, from amongst the boys, would be attended with advantages to them in life, they did not hesitate readily to adopt the suggestion. The proposal was immediately put into practice, and the results are highly satisfactory, proving (if indeed proof were necessary) that the cultivation of instrumental music amongst the children of the Hospital is not attended with that degradation of moral character so much apprehended in Dr. Burney's time. For not only has the general moral character of those instructed in music been improved, and their physical capacities enlarged, by the influence of music during their stay at the Hospital; but... considerable social advantages have been derived by many of them from this source when they have quitted the establishment...\n" +
                "\n" +
                "It is now some years since the band was formed, numbering about thirty boys from nine to fourteen years. This number has, ever since, been maintained, sometimes exceeded. The boys are selected from amongst those who possess a musical ear, due regard being paid to their physical development. As the musical instruments, to which they are placed, are essentially men's instruments, considerable physical exertion is required in playing upon them. Great care is, therefore bestowed in watching the effects this early application produces upon the health of the children; and no instance has ever occurred of injury being done by blowing. On the contrary, boys of delicate constitution have greatly improved in health from the exercise of a wind instrument.\n" +
                "\n" +
                "As a considerable portion of the time allotted to the practice of music is drawn from the ordinary school hours, great care has, also, been taken to ascertain how far the band-boys are - when brought into competition at the annual school examination with other boys not in the band - affected by this arrangement, and the results have shown that a full proportion of the prizes, awarded for scholastic pursuits has been constanty carried off by band-boys. This success at school may fairly be attributed to the salutary effects of music upon the character of those boys receiving instruction in the art, which imparts vivacity to their tempers, and by its enlightening influence, renders the mental capacities more energetic and susceptible of receiving general instruction, than the faculties of the other boys attain, who do not enjoy the advantage of musical tuition.\n" +
                "\n" +
                "During the period the band has been formed, a large number of the boys have received instruction, of whom, many, at their own desire, have been placed as musicians in the bands of Her Majesty's Household Troops, and other regiments, and also in the Royal Navy. Thus, while securing an eligible position in life for the boys, has the formation of the band proved, by saving the expenses of premium and outfit allowed for each boy ordinarily apprenticed, \"of considerable advatage to this corporation, and of national utility.\" Nor should it be lost sight of, that very many of the boys who have passed through the band, and are now occupied in various trades to which they have been apprenticed, have followed up their music as a recreation with satisfaction to themselves, and to those with whom it is their lot to be placed.",

We could see inmates of this drab place working or walking about, they seemed to us a race apart, and I always felt sorry for the children there in such dreary clothes and penned away from other people. There was one bright spot concerning the Workhouse, and that was a band composed of some of the boys. This was established in 1866, when approximately £30 had been granted to buy musical instruments for the boys in the Home. They used to play once a week on Wednesday evenings during the summer, in the circular bandstand in the [recreation ground] and Mum made a point of taking us to hear them, much to our delight and pleasure. When the boys were old enough, they were accepted into the Army as instrumentalists, so saving the Workhouse money. ",

Went with him to hear him play with Mr. Demodore [Daniel De Moivre]. He plays much better than he did. While they were playing I sat by reading a Spectator which gives an account of the story that is told of Seneca who was an old man and his young wife Paulina who was so extremely fond of him that when Nero sent to command him to die she resolved to die with him and did so",
        "[6] Diary entry 27 March 1716 I went then with Mr. [George] Smith...": "Diary entry 27 March 1716 I went then with Mr. [George] Smith to a friend of his, who plays upon the bass viol very well, who is a silk weaver and works in gold and silver and makes the richest gold and silver stuffs that are made in England. We played, Mr. Smith and I, upon the flute [recorder] and he upon the viol, and some time after a Frenchman came in who sung some of the French opera songs in concert with our two flutes [recorders] and the bass. He sung particularly that part of the opera of Psyche which we saw at Paris, in which the Vulcans come in and sing Frappons, &c. It pleased me very much as it revived in me the ideas I had when I was at Paris and filled me with that same kind of pleasure which I had when I was in the opera there. The French music has a very different air and manner from ours; it is extremely simple and easy, but there is a peculiar kind of harmony which touches me very sensibly."
